THE GREAT PEARL SECRET
</h2>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br>
IN JULIET'S SITTING ROOM
</h3>

<p>
A maid opened the door leading from a bedroom
to a salon of the "royal suite" at Harridge's Hotel.
Dusk had fallen, and entering, she switched on the
electricity.  The room, with its almost Louis
Seize decorations, was suddenly flooded with light;
and to her surprise the Frenchwoman saw a slim
black figure nestled deep among cushions on a sofa
before the fire.  A small white face, with a frame of
terra-cotta hair crushed under a mourning toque,
turned a pair of big black eyes upon her.
</p>

<p>
"Miladi West!" exclaimed the maid.  (She
pronounced it "Vest") "Pardon, Madame, I did not
know that any one was here."
</p>

<p>
She spoke in French, with an accent which told
that her first language had been Italian, learned in
the south of France; though in looks she was the
chic Parisienne.  Her English was quite good, but
when she used that tongue, her accent was of New
York.  She preferred French, however, was proud of
being French, and had Frenchified her Nicois-Italian
name of Simonetta Amaranti to Simone Amaranthe.
All Juliet Phayre's friends had to be polite to Simone.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Phayre's man let me in," said the
red-haired lady in widow's weeds.  "After I'd had a
look at the wedding presents, I was so dazzled that
I switched off the lights."  She laughed, and then
cried, "Leave the lights now!  I suppose
Mademoiselle won't be forever?"
</p>

<p>
Simone shrugged her thin shoulders just
perceptibly.  "Mademoiselle sent me out on an errand,
Miladi.  I have not long returned, with the perfume
she wanted.  It was for the <i>coiffeur</i> who is here to
wash the hair of Mademoiselle.  She would not have
the stuff he brought, so the man was obliged to wait.
I am afraid the drying, even with the hot-air machine,
will take some time.  Miladi knows what a quantity
of the hairs there are on the pretty head of
Mademoiselle, and how she is exacting of the way
everything is done!"
</p>

<p>
The red-haired lady guessed from the Frenchwoman's
tone that Simone considered the introduction
of a <i>coiffeur</i> a slight to her own skill.  "Why,
yes," she agreed.  "Mademoiselle is exacting.  But
what would you?  She is a spoiled child.  The least
crumple in a rose-leaf—by the way, Simone" (she
stopped for a little throaty chuckle), "is it true about
the <i>carpet</i> in this suite?"
</p>

<p>
"The carpet, Miladi?"  Simone flushed faintly
through her dark skin, and "Miladi" made a second
guess.  Of course Juliet trusted Simone, and
depended upon her blindly; but she—Emmy West—had
often wondered how certain spicy little items
concerning the Phayre family reached the gossip
columns of "society papers."
</p>

<p>
"I read such an amusing paragraph in <i>Modern
Ways</i> this morning," she explained.  "It was <i>apropos</i>
of the wedding, of course.  <i>Modern Ways</i> loves a
chance for a 'dig' at us Americans who marry
well-known Englishmen!  It said that when Miss Juliet
Phayre and her Uncle Henry came over from Paris
the other day, and took this royal suite which
Mr. Phayre had engaged, Miss Phayre sent for the
manager before she'd been in the hotel half an hour.
'There's a spot of ink on the carpet,' she complained
(according to the paper).  'I must have another
carpet at once.'  Now do tell me, Simone (I'm very
discreet!) did that really happen?"
</p>

<p>
"It did, Madame," the maid admitted.  "Though
how it got to these sacred journalists——"
</p>

<p>
"And did the manager say to Mademoiselle,
'We have had half the kings of Europe in this suite
since that spot appeared, Miss Phayre, and not one
of them mentioned it!'"
</p>

<p>
"His words were to that effect, Miladi, so far as I
remember.  But——"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then you <i>were</i> in the room?  What fun!
You can tell me if Juliet—if Mademoiselle replied
that a spotted carpet might be good enough for a
king; it wasn't good enough for a Phayre."
</p>

<p>
Simone flung out her hands, palm upward.  They
were beautifully manicured hands, as carefully
tended as her mistress's.  And as she smiled her
teeth showed very white.  When her face was grave,
she looked somewhat sullen, and might be thirty-five;
but the smile was rejuvenating.  It put her
back to twenty-eight, and made her almost handsome
as well as <i>chic</i>.  "Miladi has known Mademoiselle
since her schooldays, is it not?" she hedged.  "Miladi
will be able to judge as well as if I told her whether
Mademoiselle would have made that answer."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it rang true when I read it!" laughed
Lady West.  "But Simone, when you say I have
'known Mademoiselle since her schooldays', you make
me sound awfully antique.  We were at Madame
de Sain's together.  I came over to England the
year I left, and married poor Sir Algy only three
months after I was presented."  She thought it
best to hammer these details into Simone's head, in
case the woman really <i>was</i> in touch with those back-door,
kitchen-stairs reporters.  Then, to give an air
of carelessness to her words, she turned the subject.
"Perhaps you might let Mademoiselle know I've
come.  Parker told me that she was lying down—that
she'd promised her uncle to rest till tea time.
So I wouldn't have her disturbed.  But if her hair
is being washed, she might let me in."
</p>

<p>
"I will ask Miladi," said Simone.  "I came to
the salon to see if the curtains were drawn.  If
Madame permits!"  She tripped with her short,
high-heeled step first to one window, then the other,
and closed the draperies of old-rose brocade.  Having
done this, she pattered out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Emmy West's eyes followed the thin but graceful
figure in black silk.  "Simone is a character!" she
thought.  And she wondered what the maid's secret
opinion was of this marriage which would take place
next day; the richest American heiress with the
poorest British duke!
</p>

<p>
Left alone again, Emmy wriggled up from her nest
of cushions, and beguiled the time in examining the
wedding gifts once more.  This did not take long,
as the marriage had been suddenly hurried on by
special license, and friends of Juliet Phayre and the
Duke of Claremanagh had had only a few days to
send in their offerings.  Emmy had made this
uninvited visit with the object of admiring a certain
one of Juliet's presents, but she had already informed
herself that it was not on show with the rest.  Unless
the bride-elect refused to see her, she did not intend
to leave Harridge's without a glimpse—or anyhow,
news—of it.
</p>

<p>
When she had wandered languidly round the three
or four tables on which jewel cases, gold, silver, china,
and tortoise-shell things were spread, she propped
her own black-edged card conspicuously in front of a
Sevres-framed mirror, and bent down for a hasty
peep at her face in its oval.  She wondered if her
hair were a tiny touch too red.  She liked it, herself,
and thought the heart-shaped white face, with its
wide-apart black eyes set in that copper halo, a siren
face.  In the weeds of a war-widow it seemed to her
that she was almost irresistible, but she could not
help realizing that there were people who did resist
her.  The Duke was one.  And an attractive cousin
of Juliet's, John Manners, was another.  She was
vaguely aware that her own taste was decidedly vivid.
Perhaps the hair <i>was</i> rather red!  She had had it
"bobbed" since Juliet came to London, because it
worried her that Juliet should look years younger
than she.  No one would take Lady West for twenty-seven,
but she had been an "old girl" and Juliet
a "new girl," the year they met at school.  Juliet
was twenty-three now, and she, Emmy, had gone
back to twenty-five.  One had to be that, if one
had married before the war!
</p>

<p>
Quickly she dusted on a little powder from her
vanity box, and accentuated the cupid's bow of her
lips with a stick of red salve, for it was possible that
Claremanagh might "breeze in."  It would be
like him!  This thought was still in her mind when
a door behind her opened.  She turned nervously,
tucking the lip-salve into her gold mesh bag, for just
now the Duke was having a craze for baby complexions
without make-up.  But it was not the Duke.
It was a girl, standing in the doorway between
bedroom and salon.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Emmy!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Juliet!" said Emmy.  And suddenly she
felt years older than she had felt a moment ago.
Juliet Phayre was such a big baby!
</p>

<p>
The girl wore a pale pink chiffon thing which
she probably considered a dressing gown.  It was
embroidered with wild roses and banded with
swansdown, and no practical person would have dreamed
of keeping it on for a shampoo.  Juliet, however,
thought herself sufficiently protected with a towel
over her shoulders—a silvery damask towel under
which her bare, girlish arms hung down.  Over
the towel streamed masses of hair in long, wet
strands, which must be bright golden-brown when
dry.  These fell—weighted with water—nearly to
her knees, and from their curly ends drops poured
like unstrung pearls.  She was so tall and slender,
and brilliant rose-and-white, that she would have
looked to a poet like Undine just out of her fountain.
</p>

<p>
"You extravagant thing," Lady West scolded,
"to spoil a lovely boudoir gown like that!"
</p>

<p>
"Simone gets it to-morrow as a perquisite, with
all my old things," Juliet dismissed the subject.
"She said you'd been here an age, so I thought I'd
better come in.  I'll dry my hair before the fire,
presently we'll have tea."
</p>

<p>
So saying, she sat down tailor-fashion on a long,
fat velvet cushion which lay in front of the low fender.
</p>

<p>
"Evidently you're not expecting the Duke,"
laughed Lady West.
</p>

<p>
"No-o," said the girl.  "But I'm expecting a
letter from him—or something."
</p>

<p>
"You haven't got the pearls on show with your
other presents, I see," remarked her friend.  "I
don't blame you!  Of course, Parker is doing the
watch-dog act outside; and only your <i>bestest</i> pals
come up.  Still, the pearls are frightfully valuable.
And you can never tell!  But do, <i>do</i> let me see them.
I'm dying to!"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't got them yet," Juliet confessed.
</p>

<p>
"Not got them?" gasped the elder woman.
"You're joking.  Why"—and she laughed with
great gaiety—"one <i>marries</i> Claremanagh for his
pearls!"
</p>

<p>
"Does one?" Juliet took her up.  "I know whole
populations of females who'd give <i>their</i> pearls to
marry him, for—himself!"
</p>

<p>
This told Emmy West that the bride-to-be knew she
had been scratched, and was ready to scratch back.
For an instant Emmy hesitated whether to be sweet
or sharp, and decided to compromise.  "By Jove,
you <i>are</i> in love, aren't you?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"I am," Juliet admitted.  "I don't care a rap
about being a duchess.  That sort of thing
seems—somehow old-fashioned since the war.  And I
don't think I ever was a snob, thank goodness."
</p>

<p>
Emmy wondered if this were another "dig."  She
had been a Chicago girl, and only a "tuppenny
half-penny" heiress, compared to Juliet Phayre; but she
had wanted a title, and had paid all she could afford
for a mere baronet, such as her few hundred thousand
dollars would buy.  On the sofa once more facing
her low-seated hostess, she looked Juliet full in the
eyes; but Juliet's were innocent, even dreamy.  "I'd
have snapped at my Boy if he'd been just a Tommy
when I met him Over There, instead of a perfectly
gorgeous Guardsman," the girl went on.  "But, of
course, I <i>do</i> want the pearls!  I wouldn't be human
if I didn't; everyone talks about them so much,
even my Cousin Jack Manners, and says they're
so marvellous.  I expect they are what Pat is sending
around this evening."
</p>

<p>
"Sending around!" repeated the other.  "You talk
as if—as if they were a box of chocolates!
Claremanagh is the careless-est creature on earth, I know.
And he has been—er—very careless with the pearls.
But I don't think even he would be as bad as that."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked the girl to whom most jewels
meant little.  "If he sent them by Old Nick, that
dear, quaint man of his, they'd be safer than if he
brought them himself.  I never knew before that he
was superstitious.  But he is.  It's bad luck for a
Claremanagh to see his bride the day before the
wedding.  <i>Creepy</i> things have happened, it seems,
according to an old story!  So he said he wasn't
running risks.  For some reason, he couldn't give me
his present before to-day.  So that's why the thing
is to come by messenger, you see."
</p>

<p>
"I see," echoed Emmy.  "And you're sure the
present <i>will</i> be the pearls?"
</p>

<p>
This was rather an impudent question to ask,
especially for one who knew the Duke's circumstances;
but, for a wonder, Juliet did not seem to mind.  She
answered quite easily, "Oh, I suppose so.  Don't the
Claremanagh men always give them to their brides?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe they have dutifully handed them over
<i>so far</i>—for several generations, since the pearls came
into their family in that exciting way," said Lady
West.  "But you know, Peter—I mean Claremanagh—is
very independent, and quite—er—a law unto
himself."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you call him 'Peter'?" the girl branched
off from the subject.  "He has about a dozen names,
I know, but I hadn't heard that 'Peter' was one.
My selection from the lot is Pat!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, 'Peter' was only a silly nickname I made up
for him.  'Peter Pan', because he just isn't the sort
who ever grows up!" Emmy explained elaborately.
"Of course he was a lot with Algy and me the first
year I married—before the war spoilt everything for
everyone.  And then, when I took up Red Cross
work in France, after poor Algy—-"
</p>

<p>
"I know," Juliet ruthlessly interrupted.  "That
was where and when <i>I</i> came on the scene."
</p>

<p>
"It was," agreed Emmy, in a flat voice.  "You
came, you saw, you conquered.  But we were talking
of the Tsarina pearls.  I do hope the Duke <i>is</i>
'delivering the goods', as we say in our country.  I
don't mind confessing to you, my angel child, I
dropped in hoping for a private view."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I guessed <i>that</i> the minute Simone told me
you were here, and determined to wait!"  Juliet
laughed like a naughty child who dares a "grown-up"
to slap it.  Emmy's ears tingled.  The girl's tone,
though intimate and friendly, told her how
unimportant she was in the future Duchess's scheme of
things.  She had always envied Juliet, and had an
old grudge against the heiress for refusing her brother,
Bill Lowndes.  Now she suddenly hated her.  Instead
of inflicting a kittenish scratch or two, she wanted
to strike at Juliet Phayre's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she excused herself, "I never saw the
pearls, except—er—at a <i>distance</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You have seen them, then?" Juliet exclaimed.
"How was that?  Pat's mother died years before
you knew him, and only the Duchess is supposed to
wear the pearls, isn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Only the Duchess is <i>supposed</i> to wear them."
</p>

<p>
Juliet sat up straight on the velvet cushion.  Her
hair was drying beautifully now.  The red background
of fireglow lit it to flame, so that Lady West
saw the slight figure surrounded by a nimbus.  "Ever
since Pat and I were engaged, you've been hinting
at something queer, or <i>secret</i>, about that rope of
pearls, Emmy," the girl blazed.  "Now, <i>out</i> with it,
please!  Tell me what you mean."
</p>

<p>
The elder woman was taken aback.  "Don't you
<i>know</i> what I mean?" she temporized.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," snapped Juliet.  "But I'm sure it's
something unpleasant."
</p>

<p>
"At least, I had no intention of telling you," Lady
West snapped back.  "I wouldn't distress you for
worlds, dear, especially on your <i>wedding eve</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Wedding eve be—'jizzled!'" inelegantly
remarked the bride-elect.  "You sound quite early
Edwardian!  If you don't tell me, I shall think the
thing worse than it is."
</p>

<p>
"You had better ask Claremanagh, or Jack
Manners, who is a pal of his," said Emmy.
</p>

<p>
"I can't, till I have an idea what to ask them
about."
</p>

<p>
"Ask whether Lyda Pavoya ever—no, I won't
say it!"
</p>

<p>
"Whether she ever wore the pearls?  That's what
you were going to say!"
</p>

<p>
"So you <i>did</i> know?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't.  And I don't now.  I only know what
you have in your mind.  I don't believe she was
allowed to wear the pearls."
</p>

<p>
"Why should you believe it?  And even if she
did, it was before you knew Peter—the Duke.  Or
anyhow, it was before you were <i>engaged</i>.  It was
when she was dancing for the Polish Relief Fund in
Paris, that I saw——"
</p>

<p>
"You saw what?"
</p>

<p>
"Saw—her."
</p>

<p>
"Emmy!  You <i>didn't</i> see her wearing the Tsarina
pearls?  It's not possible."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course you must be right, dear.  Even
though they are <i>blue</i>, they'd be like any other pearls,
wouldn't they, <i>to see at a distance</i>."
</p>

<p>
"That's just what you said about Pat's pearls
five minutes ago: that you'd seen them only 'at a
distance.'"
</p>

<p>
Lady West did not reply.  She put on a stricken,
trapped expression, which went well with her widow's
weeds.  The two gazed into each other's eyes, each
waiting for the other to speak.  Neither heard a
sound at the door until a respectable voice—such
a voice as is never possessed save by a British butler
or valet—announced "His Grace the Duke of
Claremanagh."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br>
THE EXPLANATION
</h3>

<p>
A perfectly charming young man came in—a
young man so delightful to look at that it seemed
almost too much that he should be a duke.  With
that merry brown face (the war had left a scar across
cheek and temple), those Celtic grey eyes, that
jet-black hair, that "figure for a fencer," and above all
that engaging grin of his, the merest Nobody might
hope to make his mark as Somebody.
</p>

<p>
"Breezing in" (as Emmy had put it), he smiled
his nice smile that brought a dimple like a cut line
into each thin, tanned cheek.  The smile was for
Juliet, whose velvet throne was opposite the door,
and for her he waved aloft a small, sealed white
parcel.  Then he saw Lady West, and his expression
changed.  As the saying is, his "face fell," but in
half a second he had controlled his features.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?" he enquired.  His voice was as
pleasant as his grin, but there was a slight stiffness
in his tone for the red-haired war-widow.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going strong, thanks!  Going in every sense
of the word," Emmy assured him.  "I should have
taken myself off before now, only Juliet pretended
not to be expecting you.  Of course, the day before
the wedding <i>is</i> supposed by old-fashioned folk to be
close time for brides, where their loving bridegrooms
are concerned, and so——"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not old-fashioned," said Claremanagh.
</p>

<p>
"Rather not!  I've every reason for knowing
that.  We all have.  But Juliet had some story
about a 'bad luck' superstition.  I thought you were
the last man to be superstitious, Irish as you are,
but it didn't sound like a joke——"
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't a joke.  I'm as superstitious as the
deuce about one or two things," the man confessed.
"Juliet wasn't 'pretending' but"—and he turned
to the girl—"I had to come.  There was something
I didn't want to explain in a letter, and—hang 'bad
luck!'  It's a cross dog that would dare bite us."
</p>

<p>
As Emmy West saw the look he gave Juliet, she
felt as though her heart had been sharply pinched
between a thumb and a finger.  She had believed
till now that his "superstition" was an excuse for
spending his time with someone whose society he
preferred to the bride's.  Yet here he was, bouncing
in like a bomb, with that eager light in his eyes, and
in his hand a packet which <i>might</i> be the pearls!
</p>

<p>
When Juliet explained that there "was a reason"
why Claremanagh "couldn't give his present till
to-day," an exciting thought had tumbled into Emmy's
head: What if Lyda Pavoya had refused to return
the pearls he'd been teased into lending her, and
had taken them to New York, where she was now
dancing?  Emmy visioned the poor Duke frantically
cabling, the moment he had secured the American
heiress; or perhaps engaging a lawyer to frighten
the Polish siren.  Lyda wouldn't be easy to frighten,
Emmy imagined, admiringly.  (She, in fact, admired
the dancer so sincerely, that her own attempts at
sirenhood were copied from Pavoya.)  Even if
Lyda had disgorged the booty, would there have been
time for it to arrive from across the Atlantic?  Only
the opening of that little parcel would show, and
Emmy's jealous pain was complicated by curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Still, she decided, it would be useless to wear out
her welcome by lingering.  The chances were that
Claremanagh wouldn't break those thrilling seals
till she had gone.  Besides, Juliet was in a state of
suppressed fury, and was capable in that mood
of banishing her with rudeness.  In some moods,
the girl was capable of <i>anything</i>!  So Lady West
"kissed air" in the neighbourhood of Miss Phayre's
burning cheeks, and accepted defeat with one sole
satisfaction: If the pearls had come—or if they
ever came!—she had pretty well spoiled them for
the future Duchess.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Au revoir</i>, dearest child," she said.  "I shall be in
church to-morrow, of course.  <i>Au revoir</i>, Peter,
and good luck in spite of the Claremanagh curse.
I do hope it won't put on seven-league boots and
follow you to New York."
</p>

<p>
"Leather's too dear since the war for superannuated
old curses to buy seven-league boots," replied
the Duke, unflatteringly prompt in opening the
door.
</p>

<p>
The pretty lady went to it with wormlike meekness,
but turned on the threshold.  "If I meet the
Curse, I'll tell it to mind its business," she laughed.
"The Claremanaghs have had enough bad luck.
You'll create a new record, working out your
democratic notions in a new country, with one or two
<i>old friends</i> there to applaud them."
</p>

<p>
With this exit speech she put herself in charge of
Parker, who would ring up the lift for her.  The
Duke shut the salon door, and turned to the girl.
He didn't even say "Thank goodness, the woman's
gone!"  He seemed to have forgotten her existence.
</p>

<p>
"Heavens, what hair you have!" he exclaimed.
"I knew it must be gorgeous, but I didn't dream of
<i>this</i>.  To-night I <i>shall</i> dream of it!  By rights, I
oughtn't to have seen this show till to-morrow night,
ought I?  But I'm glad I have.  All your beauties
bursting upon me at once would be too much for my
brain."
</p>

<p>
"Don't make fun of me," Juliet laughed, with a
wistfulness rather pathetic in so pretty and so rich
a girl.
</p>

<p>
"Make fun of you!"  Claremanagh snatched her
up from the low seat, and crushed the yielding, thinly
clad young body in his arms.  On the sweet-scented,
damp hair he rained kisses.  "Am I a wooden man?
Take that—and that, to punish you!  Mavourneen—if
it were <i>to-morrow</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Between warm joy and chilling doubt Juliet
Phayre shivered.  If only she could believe him—believe
that he cared for her, and not for the money!
She almost had believed—before Emmy West came.
</p>

<p>
The girl burned to tell "Pat" what Emmy had
said and hinted.  If he could reassure her, it would
be balm on a wound never quite healed.  But—<i>if
he couldn't</i>.  If questioning should make bad
things worse?  Then she would wish in vain that
she'd "let sleeping dogs lie," because she loved the
man too much to give him up.  She had wanted him
as a child wants the moon, ever since the day she,
a gilt-edged Red Cross nurse, had met him, a soldier
on leave, in Paris.  Now she had got him—or
almost—and the future <i>might</i> be so wonderful!
</p>

<p>
He had promised her uncle, Henry Phayre, to
live for at least half of each year in America, there to
work as other men worked (Phayre would supply
the employment), and Juliet had looked forward to
being proud of her adorable husband, happy with him;
a living proof—the pair of them—that an American
girl can marry a duke for himself, not for his title;
that a duke can make an American heiress his wife
for love.  But now, Emmy had raked up those old
rags of gossip, nearly forgotten.  And Juliet had
read in the paper only a few days ago about
Pavoya's first night in New York; the furore her
"wild eastern dancing and strange, Slavic fascination"
had created.  The girl felt sick at heart as she
asked herself if Pat's pleasure in the thought of
"seeing New York" had any connection with
Pavoya's presence there.
</p>

<p>
It was all she could do not to purr out her
complaints of "that <i>cat</i>, Emmy West," but native
prudence prevailed over hot impulse.  She enjoyed as
much as Emmy permitted Pat's praise of her glorious
hair (surely Pavoya's wasn't as long or thick, and
probably its "rusty red" was due to dye), and then
she reminded him of the parcel.
</p>

<p>
"Is it my present from you?" she asked, almost
shyly, nodding toward the table where Pat had
thrown the neat white square.
</p>

<p>
Instantly he let her go, and took the little parcel
again in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sweet, it <i>is</i> my present for you," he said.
"But <i>not</i> the present I wanted to give you.  That's
why I risked the 'curse' and came to explain."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" was the girl's noncommittal answer.  Her
heart sank.  The pearls were not in the packet,
she knew now, but her disappointment was not so
much in missing them as in the thought that Emmy
could say "I told you so!"
</p>

<p>
"Before you open these silly seals, and see what
I've brought," the Duke went on, "I want to make
my explanation, and be sure you understand the
whole business.  Come and sit by me on the sofa,
will you?"
</p>

<p>
He drew her down beside him, and gathered her close.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, you know all about our pearls, the
one ewe lamb of ancient glory left to us poor
Claremanaghs," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know <i>all</i> about them," amended Juliet,
her heart missing a beat.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me just what you do know, and then I
shan't bore you with repetitions."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, people have told me things," she hedged.
"Didn't a Tsarina of Russia sell the pearls to some
old ancestor of yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Good lord, no!" he chuckled.  "Never was a
Claremanagh so stony broke as yours truly; yet
never was there one since the days of pterodactyls
who could run to the price of a Tsarina's pearls;
that is, in <i>lucre</i>.  My great-great-grandfather bought
them with kisses.  But joking apart, it's rather a
romantic tale.  He was a soldier and offered his
services to Russia because he'd seen a portrait
of the Tsarina, which the Prince of Wales had, and
fell in love with it.  Well, she fell in love with him,
too, at sight.  He wasn't bad to look at, judging
from his portrait——"
</p>

<p>
"Was he like you?" cut in Juliet.
</p>

<p>
Pat laughed.  "They say so.  When we can get
those Pill people out of Castle Claremanagh (their
lease has a year to run) you shall tell me if you find
a likeness.  There was an 'affair' between the two;
and great-great-grandfather Pat (he was Patrick,
too, like all the eldest sons) had it politely intimated
to him, through his friend Wales, that he'd better
come home—a marriage had been arranged for him.
He'd not have stirred a foot if it hadn't been for his
Love.  She begged him to go.  There was a plot
to murder him, it seems, and as for her, she'd ceased
to be very popular with the Tsar, her husband.
She made her sweetheart promise to marry the English
girl, and she gave him the rope of pearls which
since then have been called after her—the 'Tsarina's
pearls.'  They were for his wife, as a gift from her,
so the girl shouldn't hate the thought of their love."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> should have hated it all the more!" cried Juliet.
"I wouldn't have <i>worn</i> the things if I'd been his bride."
</p>

<p>
"Well, as <i>my</i> bride I hope you will wear them
often.  They'll be dashed becoming to your blondness,
for the things are unique in one way: they're
<i>blue</i>; a hundred and eighty immense and perfectly
matched blue pearls.  Never has anything been seen
like them, the expert johnnies say."
</p>

<p>
"Was the Tsarina a blonde?" the girl wanted to know.
</p>

<p>
"A copper-headed blonde.  You shall see her
miniature."
</p>

<p>
Juliet said nothing.  But she thought of Lyda
Pavoya's head.  She had never seen the Polish
dancer, but she had heard her described: the traditional
"siren-green" eyes, white face, and red hair.
And she knew that Emmy West modelled herself,
so far as Nature permitted, on Pavoya.
</p>

<p>
"In the ordinary sense of the word, the Tsarina
pearls aren't an heirloom in our family," Claremanagh
continued.  "But the first bride who received them
passed on the gift to her eldest son's bride.  So it
has gone on ever since.  The thing falls to the heir,
or his wife; and it's tacitly understood that neither
the rope as a whole, nor even one of the pearls, shall
be sold.  Well, I came into the inheritance (if you
can call it that) seven years ago, when I was
twenty-one.  I'm afraid I'd have sold the bally thing more
than once if I could have done it in common
decency.  But I couldn't.  So there you <i>are</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"What <i>did</i> you do with it?" Juliet ventured, half
dreading the answer.  Her head was pressed close
to Pat's shoulder.  She could not look up at his face,
but she thought a muscle jumped in the arm that
held her, and that there was a sudden change in his
tone.
</p>

<p>
"Do with it?" he echoed.  "Why, what should
I do but keep it in the bank waiting for the Lady
of my Dreams?  I couldn't wear it round my neck,
you know!  But, well, I did get it out of the bank
now and then, to show to beautiful beings who begged
to see it.  Once it was in a Loan Exhibition for the
benefit of something or other, I forget what.  The
confession I have to make, though, is this: only two
months before I met the dearest girl on earth I was
so hard up I'd have had to grind a monkey-organ
in the streets if I hadn't been engaged in fighting for
King and Country.  I'd had some beastly bad luck
with a speculation an alleged pal had let me in
for, and honest Injun, I didn't know which way to
turn, until a chap I know offered me two hundred
thousand francs on the security of the pearls."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Francs?</i>" echoed Juliet.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The man's a Frenchman.  And the business
was done in France.  He's a dashed good fellow
in his way.  But it's a queer way.  He's a kind of
gilded, super money-lender.  His transactions are
only with his friends, and the interest he takes is fair
and square: twenty per cent. instead of sixty or so,
as the sharks do—to my bitter knowledge.  With
what I got from Louis Mayen I paid my debts, and
hung onto a bit, a few thousands.  Then, two months
later, I met you—and the fat was in the fire!"
</p>

<p>
"How, in the fire?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I made up my mind at first sight to grab
you if I could——"
</p>

<p>
Juliet broke out laughing like a child, forgetful
of her secret burden.  "<i>Did</i> you—really?  So did
I you!"
</p>

<p>
"Bold hussy!"  He kissed her with passion.
"But it was worse for me than you.  I'd just lost
my chance of giving you your legitimate wedding
present—if you'd have me.  The day you said
'Yes', instead of walking on air I could have thrown
myself in the sea, I felt such a fool."
</p>

<p>
"Silly boy!" cried the girl.  "Any real money-lender,
or even your super, gilded one, would have
let you have all you wanted if you'd said you were
marrying Silas Phayre's heiress.  I mayn't know
much about business, but I know that!"
</p>

<p>
"And I mayn't be a saint, but I'm not a cad,"
Claremanagh capped her.  "I wouldn't go to a
money-lender on the strength of being engaged to
you.  I don't say that if Louis Mayen had been
in France then I'd not have wheedled the pearls
back from him, on the mere strength of friendship,
and an I.O.U., or some such arrangement.  He'd
have trusted me," Pat laughed; "anyhow, in the
circumstances!  But you and I were engaged a
fortnight after the Armistice, you remember.  Just
a week before our own Great Day (yours and mine)
Mayen went to Russia with a lot of important
Frenchmen of Hebrew blood, on a diplomatic mission.
He had a bad time in Petrograd.  He and his lot
were stuck into the prison of St. Peter and St. Paul,
by the Bolchies.  I didn't know where the pearls
were and couldn't find out.  That was two months
ago.  But after six weeks in a cell, Mayen was
released by order of Lenine; and it was expected in
Paris that he and the rest would be back in France
by now.
</p>

<p>
"We were there ourselves—you and your uncle
in Paris, and I at G.H.Q. you know, till just ten
days ago—though it seems longer.  And I was
hoping against hope that Mayen might turn up.  I
wouldn't say a word to you, for I didn't want you to
be disappointed.  And even as late as last night I
wouldn't quite give up.  Your Cousin Jack Manners,
who is the best fellow on earth, has been watching
things for me in Paris.  He'd heard that Mayen had
quietly sneaked back, and hadn't let any one know,
in order to get a good rest cure.  But this turns out
to be a <i>canard</i>.  Now you see why I had to go out
and find you a 'fairing' as the Scots say.  I couldn't
afford anything worth while unless I borrowed; so
I thought things over, and decided that you'd prefer
a little remembrance of our wedding, bought with
my own 'pocket-money,' and supplemented by a
souvenir of my mother.  Am I right?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely!  Whatever you give me, I shall
love it," said Juliet.  "I wouldn't care if it cost
sixpence.  It's from <i>you</i>; that makes the value for me.
But, Pat, I can't bear to think of your being poor!
You won't be after to-morrow.  I haven't liked to
talk of such things, but I told Uncle Henry I wanted
a million dollars settled on you, to use as you pleased.
Surely he did what I——"
</p>

<p>
"He did, my child.  But I 'wasn't taking any'.
I meant to tell you this myself when we were old
married people—a week after the wedding, let's say!
But since you've brought up the subject, we might
as well have it out.  Your money is going to restore
Claremanagh, and the jolly old London house in
Queen Anne's gate that my great-grandfather
bought.  I don't so much mind that.  You'll enjoy
the places.  And it won't be till the tenants there
turn out.  I'm to have a screw from your uncle for
pretending to work in the S. P. Phayre Bank: a
hundred dollars a week to begin with (he offered
more, but I wouldn't have it), about a fiftieth part
of which I'll really earn.  But even that will bring
me nearly a hundred pounds a month, so I shan't
disgrace my wife by wearing paper collars or
elastic-sided boots, or not getting my hair cut.  Then, as
my earning power increases, so will my pay.
Besides, your noble guardian wants to buy my place
at Maidenhead, when it's free, next spring.  He'll
give sixty thousand pounds, which will leave me
fifty when the mortgage is paid off; and Mr. Phayre
will advise me about investments.  So you see, you're
not marrying a pauper after all, my good girl!  As
for the pearls, it's only a delay—an annoying delay.
When Mayen really does get back to Paris, he'll
find a letter from me containing a post-dated cheque
for the two hundred thousand francs, and interest.
That will come out of the fifty thousand pounds,
and still leave me a decent pile.  Mayen will at once
take steps to get the pearls to me."
</p>

<p>
"But we'll be in New York," objected Juliet.  "How
can Monsieur Mayen send them without danger of
their being stolen?"
</p>

<p>
"Trust him to arrange that," Claremanagh
soothed her.  "There must be lots of ways.  Besides,
they'll be insured for their full value, which
is supposed to be—intrinsic, not sentimental—one
hundred thousand pounds.  What I hope is, they'll
be in time for you to make a show in your box at the
opera—Metropolitan Opera House, you call it,
don't you?  You see, I've been reading up a guide
book to New York!  And now I've made all my
explanations and excuses, my darling, you'd better
open the poor little box."
</p>

<p>
His arm still round her, the girl broke the jeweller's
seals.  Inside the white paper was a white velvet
case, and inside the white velvet case was a string
of white pearls.  They were small, but good, and
from them depended an old-fashioned, open-faced
locket containing an ivory miniature of a beautiful
boy.
</p>

<p>
"The pearls are from me," Pat said.  "The locket
and miniature are from my mother.  She used
always to wear the locket.  And when she died,
eight years ago, one of the last things she did was
to give it to me, 'for my bride'."
</p>

<p>
Juliet Phayre would not have been human if
she had not forgotten, in that moment, both Emmy
West and Lyda Pavoya.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br>
"TO MEET THE DUCHESS"
</h3>

<p>
Mrs. Lowndes, Emmy West's sister-in-law, was
giving a luncheon for the Duchess of Claremanagh;
and the Duchess was late.  Nine lovely ladies
(including the hostess) were waiting for her in the
Futurist drawing room of an apartment overlooking
the Park.  It was not to all tastes a beautiful
drawing room, but it was expensive for all purses.
So was the apartment; too expensive, Billy Lowndes'
friends said, for his.  As for the ladies, each one was
beautiful, or her clothes were; for Nat Lowndes had
chosen her guests with the special view of impressing
the Duchess, whom Billy had tried to marry when
she was Miss Phayre.
</p>

<p>
The invitations were for one-fifteen, and before
one-thirty everyone had arrived—except the Duchess.
By twenty to two the nine voices were chattering
with almost abnormal gaiety, but ears and eyes were
secretly on the alert.  Natalie Lowndes was not
precisely in the Duchess' "set", or if she was, moved
on the chilled outer edge of it.  These women who
chatted in her startling salon would have preferred
other engagements, if they had not been asked "to
meet the Duchess of Claremanagh."  Most of them
knew that Billy had desperately wanted Juliet
Phayre, and that Juliet had been at school with his
sister, Lady West, now in London.  Their private
opinion was that the Duchess had accepted for Lady
West's sake rather than Mrs. Lowndes'; and as
the minutes lagged, they wondered if the chief guest
were purposely proving her slight esteem of the circle.
</p>

<p>
This idea ruffled their vanity, and as they talked,
glancing at wrist watches, their irritation grew.
Natalie who, like her husband, was from the Middle
West, felt the atmosphere of her overheated
room fall to zero.  She began to feel sick at heart, and
tears pricked her eyelids.  But she kept a brave front.
</p>

<p>
No one had spoken yet of the delay, nor of the
lady who caused it; but at a quarter to two it seemed
better to be frank.
</p>

<p>
"I can't think what can have happened to Juliet!"
Natalie said.  (Nat was one of those women who
always called her smartest acquaintances by their
Christian names—behind their backs.) "We'll wait
five minutes more—not a moment longer.  I'm sure
she wouldn't wish it."
</p>

<p>
"Royalties are always so prompt," said Mrs. Sam
Selby-Saunders, who knew the habits of kings
and queens from the Sunday Supplements.  "Evidently
dukes—or anyhow duchesses—don't follow
their example."
</p>

<p>
"Something must be the matter," Nat defended
the absent.  "At first Juliet was afraid she couldn't
accept to-day.  You know, there's a meeting this
morning at Mrs. Van Esten's, to arrange details of
the wonderful roof garden show in aid of the
Armenians.  Juliet had to be present, as she's on the
committee.  But at last she decided she could get away
in time.  She must have been kept."
</p>

<p>
Nobody spoke for a minute.  If there had been
only Ten First Families in New York, Mrs. Van
Esten would still have been high on the list.  She
was the organizer of the proposed entertainment,
the plans for which were thrilling the town; and if
this business were keeping the Duchess, she was
almost excusable.  Anyhow, nobody's feelings need
be hurt.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, in the midst of the pause, Miss Solomon
laughed.  Her father was as rich as Silas Phayre had
been, and there was no reason why she shouldn't
be a duchess, too, some day, when travel abroad
became easier.  "I did hear the <i>loveliest</i> thing!" she
chuckled.  "I wonder if any of you have heard
it? ... That Mrs. Van Esten meant to propose at
the committee meeting to-day the name of Lyda
Pavoya."
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, for <i>what</i>?" gasped Nat Lowndes.
</p>

<p>
"To dance at the entertainment, of course.
Mrs. Van E.'s maid and my maid are cousins.  So
I should say it was true.  You know Mrs. Van E. is
notorious for never listening to gossip.  She prides
herself on 'being above it'.  Very silly, <i>I</i> think.
Because one can make such awful 'gaffs' if one
doesn't know the seamy side of things."
</p>

<p>
"No wonder the Duchess is late!" cried Mrs. Sam.
"She has probably had to go home between
the meeting and here to faint or have a fit."
</p>

<p>
Nobody could help laughing, and nobody tried
to help it.  There was a weekly paper in New York—a
paper called the <i>Inner Circle</i>.  This publication
one got one's maid to buy and hide under a pile of
books until it could be read.  The moment all its
paragraphs had been absorbed the paper was
destroyed, thus making it possible to say, "the <i>Inner
Circle</i>!  I wouldn't give the wretched rag
houseroom!"  The inside middle pages of the "rag" were
headed "Let's Whisper!" And at the time of the
Phayre-Claremanagh marriage, two months ago, the
choicest whispering had concerned the Duke's
flirtation with Lyda Pavoya.
</p>

<p>
"It is easier to break off a flirtation than an
engagement, because you can't be sued for breach
of promise," was one <i>mot</i> of "The Whisperer," and
it was intimated that the Duke had profited by this
immunity when he proposed to Miss Phayre.  "But
what about the pearls?" was a question which no
one had forgotten, and for which everyone wanted
an answer.  Oh, yes, it would be a rich joke if
Mrs. Van Esten proposed Pavoya for a "star turn" at the
Armenian charity entertainment!
</p>

<p>
"If it's true," said Nat, "Juliet couldn't very well
refuse her consent to have Pavoya.  That would
make things worse.  As it is, none of us could help
noticing how she has kept the Duke away from every
single opera where Pavoya has danced.  Not once
has he or she been in their box on a Pavoya night.
But——"
</p>

<p>
The company hung on the word, as Nat drew in
her breath, and paused for effect.  Never were they
to know, however, what revelation was to follow
that "but," for at this instant Mrs. Lowndes'
butler announced "The Duchess of Claremanagh,"
and left out the preface of "Her Grace."
</p>

<p>
His omission upset the hostess so much that she
stammered over her greeting, and forgot what she
had read in a book called "English Etiquette" about
introducing a duchess.  Juliet Claremanagh was so
contrite for her own guilt, however, that she had no
thought for others' shortcomings.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm <i>dreadfully</i> sorry to be late!  Do forgive
me, everyone!" she cried, like a penitent schoolgirl.
"I was kept so long at that meeting, and then I had
to dash home for a minute.  My husband had made
me <i>promise</i>.  You see, this is supposed to be a great
day for me.  The pearls—perhaps you've heard of
them?—are due at last!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps" they had heard of the pearls!  The
Duchess was forgiven at once.  Introductions were
hastily made.  As the party sat down, the guest
of honour pulling off her gloves, she went on
with her excuses.  Evidently she was willing to
talk of the pearls, so Nat ventured an entering
wedge.
</p>

<p>
"Emmy wrote me they had to be re-strung,"
she said.  "And that the most skilled pearl-stringer
in England wasn't demobilized, or something; so
you had to wait."  What Emmy had really written
was, "This is the story they're putting round."
But it would be exciting to get Juliet's answer, and
watch Juliet's face.
</p>

<p>
The Duchess was somewhat paler than Juliet
Phayre had been, for she and the Duke had made a
huge success in New York, and were in such request
that they kept appalling hours.  But she was rosier
than she had ever been as she replied that, yes, she
had had to wait.  But at last the pearls had been
sent.  They were on the <i>Britannia</i>, in care of a
trusted person; and that person had "wirelessed"
that he would be at the house by half-past twelve.
Unluckily, however, the <i>Britannia</i> had been delayed
outside for a sister ship to leave the dock.
She—Juliet—had gone home from Mrs. Van Esten's to
receive the messenger, with her husband.  But the
former and Pat's trusted man, sent to meet him,
had not arrived.  She had waited a few minutes,
and had then come on in the car to Mrs. Lowndes'.
Of course, the auto had been detained for ages, at
two or three crossings!  It was always like that if
one were late!  And now she could not be at home
when the pearls appeared, for there were engagements,
which couldn't be broken, for the whole of
the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
After all, the luncheon was a great success.  The
Duchess atoned for her sins by being "sweet" to
everyone, much sweeter than she had troubled herself
to be, as a spoiled young girl, with strangers.
She was as pleased as a child with the delicious dishes
ordered, almost with prayer, by Nat; and when she
was obliged to go, after coffee and cigarettes, she
left behind her a charming impression.
Mrs. Selby-Saunders and Miss Solomon and all the rest made
up for their sharp speeches by praising the bride's
beauty and exquisite clothes.
</p>

<p>
"She's much prettier than she used to be," generously
said Nat (who had never seen Juliet as Miss
Phayre), "and the Duke must be a fool if he likes
Lyda Pavoya better.  If he neglects his wife, she
won't have any trouble finding someone else who
won't."
</p>

<p>
"What about that cousin of hers, Jack Manners,
who used to be in love with her when she was almost
a child?—a nephew of her mother's," asked
Mrs. Selby-Saunders.  "An awfully nice fellow!  She ought
to have married him.  They say he volunteered
before America joined the Allies, because she refused
him——"
</p>

<p>
"He's in France still," Nat supplied the information
eagerly.  "My sister-in-law, Lady West, met
him there——"
</p>

<p>
"I saw in some newspaper that he was to sail for
home on the <i>Britannia</i>" said Miss Solomon.
"Perhaps <i>he</i> is the messenger bringing the pearls!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br>
THE LETTER WITH THE TSARINA'S SEAL
</h3>

<p>
John Manners was not the messenger bringing the
pearls.  Even if he had been asked to bring them, he
would not have accepted the responsibility of escorting
Claremanagh's "ewe lamb" across the Atlantic.
He knew more about those pearls than he wanted
to know, for he had been in love with Juliet Phayre
before he began to like Claremanagh—to like him
in spite of himself, in spite of natural jealousy, and in
spite of prejudice.  It was a mere coincidence that
he should be on the same ship with Monsieur Mayen's
messenger, for with the return of Mayen from Russia,
Manners' friendly services for the Duke came to an
end.
</p>

<p>
His services for France were ended also; and he was
keenly interested in his own emotions as he touched
the bell on the front door of the Phayre house.  How
would it feel to meet Juliet married—and married
to a man with whom fate had queerly forced him
into friendship?
</p>

<p>
The front door was a very elaborate door.  It was
mostly composed of old wrought iron so delicately
carved as to be like iron lacework.  Silas Phayre
had imported it from an ancient palazzo in Florence
and, characteristically, had it backed with modern
plate glass.  The inner side of this crystal screen
was curtained with creamy silk tissue, thus forming
a sort of mirror for any one waiting to enter.  Manners
gazed vaguely at his reflection behind the pattern
of wrought iron, and his sense of humour noted that
thwarted love had not made of him a haggard wreck.
Fighting in France had browned and hardened him.
He was lean, but far from frail.  The dark tan on his
face caused his yellowish hair to seem straw-coloured
in contrast, and his eyes boyishly blue.  This, and
the khaki uniform he still wore, gave him an air of
being younger than he was—twenty-eight: and the
man and his image were exchanging an amused grin
when a new reflection appeared in the glass.
Mechanically Manners turned, and found himself face
to face with a woman.  She had paused at the foot
of the marble steps, and hesitated, as if the sight of
someone on the threshold had upset her calculations.
But at this instant the door was thrown open—not
by one of the imported English footmen whom
Manners knew of old, but by an elderly Japanese.
The yellow face gave Jack a shock, but he realized
that British and American youths had been better
employed than as footmen since he himself had gone
to France.
</p>

<p>
The Japanese looked past the officer in khaki to
the lady, whom he appeared to recognize and even
to be expecting.  This look settled matters for her.
She decided to keep to her original plan.  With a
slight inclination of the head to Manners, she stepped
briskly into the vestibule.  Behind her, she left a
faint trail of alluring fragrance.  Even Jack Manners,
who disliked artificial perfumes, breathed it in with
pleasure.  He had never smelled anything quite
like it before; but he thought of an eastern garden
in moonlight, and the thrill of that picture mingled
with another thrill.  He had recognized the woman.
He had seen her before, but only on the stage, and
now she was veiled with one of those patterned veils
almost as concealing for an ordinary woman as a
mask.  But this was not an ordinary woman.  It
was Pavoya, the Polish dancer; the "divine Pavoya,"
the "diabolic Pavoya," according to the point of
view.  Even lacking the green glint of slanted eyes,
the fiery glow of close-banded hair through the veil,
that figure in the plain black dress would have been
unmistakable.  Portrait painters, photographers,
post-impressionists, and caricaturists had rendered
it familiar, in all lands, to those who had not seen
the dancer herself.  Manners could hardly believe
in the truth of his swift impression.  It was almost
incredible that she should come as a guest to this
house.  Could she have made friends with Juliet?
Juliet's cousin wondered.
</p>

<p>
The thing that happened next was still more
strange.  The slim siren in black did not wait to be
ushered in by the servant.  She flitted from vestibule
to hall beyond, then vanished as if she knew
where to go and was in haste to get there.  The
Japanese did not turn his head to look after her,
but gave his attention to the man on the doorstep.
</p>

<p>
"I'm Captain Manners," said Jack.  "I've come
to see my cousin, the Duchess.  I suppose she is at
home?"  He supposed this, not only because Juliet
knew that he was due on the <i>Britannia</i>, and had
cabled her desire to see him at once, but also because
Mademoiselle Pavoya must have gone in by appointment.
Even before the servant answered, however,
he read in the troubled dark face that something
had gone wrong.
</p>

<p>
"Please to walk in, sir," said the Japanese, in stiff,
correct English.  "I have a note for you from
Her Grace the Duchess.  She was unfortunately
obliged to go out; but I think she hopes to be back
early.  If you will kindly walk into the Persian
room, sir, I will give you the letter."
</p>

<p>
Well did Jack remember the Persian room!  It
had been Silas Phayre's great fad and favourite,
and during his life had been used as a smoking room.
Jack half expected to find Lyda Pavoya there,
perhaps reading another note from Juliet; but the
wonderful room, with its rare tiles and priceless
rugs and exquisite old tapestries, was unoccupied.
The servant placed an envelope on an antique tray
of Persian enamel, and presented it with a bow.
Then he went out unobtrusively, leaving Manners
to study with some interest the seal Juliet had used.
</p>

<p>
It seemed superfluous that she should use any at
all, as the scrawled address showed that the writer
had been in haste; but the interesting thing was the
seal itself.  It was Claremanagh's own seal, which
he kept for his private correspondence, and the ring
with which he made it had been given by the Tsarina
of the Pearls to his great-great-grandfather.  Jack
happened to know this, because the Duke had ordered
a copy made for Louis Mayen, with which to seal the
box containing the pledged pearls.  Claremanagh
had told Jack this story before leaving France, and
had pointed out the ring, which he invariably wore.
The design was an eye; and the motto underneath
was, "Je te regard."
</p>

<p>
"Must have given the ring to Juliet," Manners
thought, as he opened the envelope.  He read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
DEAR OLD BOY:
</p>

<p class="letter">
Don't think me a beast to be out.  I really couldn't help it.
I was dragged into accepting for a tiresome lunch party, given
by a tiresome female, in my honour: Emmy West's sister-in-law.
Some story has been started that I was jealous of Emmy (among
other women!) with Pat.  <i>Nonsense</i>!  But I knew, if I refused,
what the creatures would say.  Besides, I couldn't be sure just
when you'd turn up.  And above all, I wanted a chance to see
you quite, quite alone.  I've got lots of things to tell you, that I
couldn't tell any one else.  If you call while I'm away, as I
expect, stop and see Pat, who is to lunch at home, as he's got a bad
cold.  Then say you must go, as you have an engagement.  That
will be true, because I now invite you to make an engagement
with me.  But if he insists on your visiting us, before you go
home to Long Island, as he's sure to, do accept.  You were
horrid to answer my cable with a refusal, and say you had to go
at once to your own place to decide on some silly old improvements
you want to make.  That's only an excuse, Jack, because
you didn't quite see yourself staying in the house with Pat and
me.  But you are much too strong a man to mind a little thing
like that.  I don't believe you were ever in love with me, really.
You just <i>thought</i> you were, that's all, from knowing me when I was
a wee kid, and always being my <i>bestest pal</i> whom I could count
on without fail.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Oh, Jack, I do count on you now, as I never did before.  So you
won't fail me for the first time in your life, will you?  I suppose
this is selfish of me, and "exactly like a woman" (as Uncle
Henry used to say, whenever I wanted to do anything he didn't
want me to do), but I can't help it.  You'll see, when I tell you,
why <i>nobody</i> else can be of any use to me in this trouble.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I <i>have</i> to write all this, though I hope to meet you so soon;
because if I didn't, you might refuse Pat's most pressing
invitation.  And where should I be then?  Don't think for an instant
that I'm tired of Pat, and want a divorce or anything.  It isn't
that at all.  I adore him as much as ever.  That's where the
trouble comes in!  But we've had a <i>row</i>, and every day it will
get worse.  Why, even the seal ring, which I'm using for this
letter, has become a bone of contention—among other things.
This does need a seal, if ever a letter did, for it's dreadfully
indiscreet and unwifely, I suppose.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Already I've eased my mind a little by pouring out my woes
to you, as in old times.  And now for that engagement with me,
which I trust you to keep.  I am supposed to go to an "At Home,"
which I'm not sure isn't given for me.  All I am sure about is
that I shan't be there.  Instead, I'll be in the Palm Room of the
Hotel Lorne (where no one we know ever goes for tea) at five
o'clock.  And I shall <i>wait for you</i>, so you'll have to come.
Afterward, if you haven't done it before, you can see to sending all
your things to our house for a visit of <i>at least</i> a week.  But we'll
talk of that!
</p>

<p class="letter">
  Ever your affectionate cousin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JEWEL.<br>
</p>

<p class="letter">
P. S. You see, I haven't forgotten your old name for me.  No
one except you ever called me his "Jewel."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Manners had read this letter through, he
sat with it for some moments in his hand.  Then,
suddenly, he roused himself to realize that it was not
a document to flaunt in the open.  He replaced
it in the envelope, which he slipped into an inner
pocket of his khaki coat.  Had the Japanese told
Claremanagh of his arrival, he wondered?  Or had
there been some secret understanding between the
Duchess and her servant that Captain Manners should
be left long enough in the Persian room to read and
put out of sight her sealed letter?  Claremanagh had
his own confidential man, Nickson (known as "Old
Nick"); why should not Juliet have hers?  There was
no reason.  Yet Jack hated to think that the girl
should be driven to a rather sordid expedient, and
somehow this thought dragged into his head another.
</p>

<p>
"By George!" he exploded aloud.  Then he bit his
lip.  But the thought could not be pushed away.
Since Juliet was out, to whom was the visit of Lyda
Pavoya being made?
</p>

<p>
The Japanese seemed to be in the confidence of
more than one person in this house!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br>
THE THIRD RINGER OF THE BELL
</h3>

<p>
Simone had been in the act of coming downstairs,
dressed for a walk with her mistress's English bulldog,
Admiral Beatty, when a vision flashed through the
hall: a reedlike figure in black with a glint of red
hair through a patterned veil.
</p>

<p>
Simone stopped short, petrified, pulling so suddenly
at the dog's leash that the reticent bull gave a
grunt.
</p>

<p>
It took a great deal to petrify Simone.  She had
been through an earthquake in Italy.  She had
escaped from a burning hotel in her first year of
service in New York.  There had been further
sensations also, and her nerves were accustomed to
shocks.  But to see Lyda Pavoya, the dancer,
dart unannounced through the hall, when the
Duke was alone in the house, went beyond everything.
</p>

<p>
She was certain, despite the veil, that the woman
was Pavoya.  No other creature on earth had a
figure like that, or held her head so like a light flower
on a stem.  The Duchess was tall and slim and graceful,
with a slender, long throat; but she had the
slightness of a normal, charmingly formed young
girl.  The Polish dancer was almost a thing
supernatural, a streak of living flame made woman.
</p>

<p>
Simone's dark skin was thick, but her head was
not.  Her brain worked fast.  Like a general at
manoeuvres, it reviewed the situation at a glance.  The
Duke was at home because of a "<i>cold!</i>"  He had
known for days that the Duchess would be out for
luncheon, and that she was safe not to return home
<i>en surprise</i>.  He must have invited Pavoya to come
in his wife's absence.  And more than this, it struck
Simone that the visit of to-day could not be the
first.  Togo, the Japanese (of whom she was jealous
because of her mistress's fancy for his services),
seemed to be acquainted with the dancer.  He let
her pass without a word.  No doubt she had been
to the house before, when the Duchess and Simone
were out of the way.  Either the Duke or Pavoya—or
both—had bribed Togo, who was playing a mean,
double game between his master and mistress!  The
Frenchwoman resolved that she would not, after
all, take Beatty for a walk.  Bending down, she
unfastened the leash from his expensive collar, on which
was engraved: "Miss America from her British Ally.
P.C. to J.P."
</p>

<p>
Feeling himself free the dog instantly turned and
spraddled back to the Adored One's boudoir, where
he was privileged to wallow among all the prettiest
cushions.  Such wallowing he much preferred to a
promenade with Simone or any one else save his
worshipped Duchess.
</p>

<p>
As Simone rose from her stooping posture, she
saw that Togo had ushered a man into the house.  A
second glance enabled her to recognize this man, and
she was more amused than surprised to see that it
was Captain Manners.  Juliet had not asked her
maid to deliver the secret letter, because it would be
simpler for the man who opened the door to do so,
and as the confidential mission was given to another,
the Duchess had prudently refrained for mentioning
it to Simone.  The latter imagined her mistress
must mentally have mislaid the fact that she herself
had seen in the papers: Captain Manners' return on
the <i>Britannia</i>, from France.
</p>

<p>
In any case, here he was, and all that was cynical
in Simone laughed at the <i>contretemps</i>.  He was
certain to have asked for the Duke, as the Duchess
was out.  Would Togo, who had just let in Pavoya,
venture to interrupt a <i>tête-à-tête</i>, by announcing that
Her Grace's cousin had arrived?  It occurred to
Simone that the Japanese had not dared to turn
away so important a person, but that, having let
him in, he would find some way of excusing the Duke.
</p>

<p>
The situation was too dramatic to waste.  The
Frenchwoman pictured His Grace's expression, faced
by his wife's cousin and loyal friend.  She had wanted
her mistress to marry Claremanagh, because it was
distinguished to be the maid of a Duchess, but she
had liked Manners and received many a tip from
him in days gone by.  For that reason, and for others
even more important, she must help Manners catch
his cousin Juliet's husband and Lyda Pavoya together.
</p>

<p>
Thinking quickly, she tripped down the broad
marble staircase which led to the great hall—a
staircase that she was the one servant permitted
to use.  She had not passed the midway landing,
however, when a second Japanese—a youth under the
command of Togo—went hurrying toward the front
door.
</p>

<p>
The electric bell was not audible to any one in the
hall, but Simone guessed that a third caller had
rung.  In Togo's absence with Captain Manners,
it was the duty of Huji to answer the door.  The
maid flew down the remaining steps, and was in time
to hear the Japanese in embarrassed conversation
with the latest arrival.  This person was speaking
broken English, and Huji, not as fluent in that tongue
as Togo, could not understand.
</p>

<p>
"A Frenchman!" decided Simone.  "<i>Mon Dieu</i>,
it will be the messenger with the pearls!"
</p>

<p>
She stepped forward with a smile.  "<i>Monsieur</i>,"
she said, "<i>Je suis Française, la femme de chambre
de la Duchesse.  Si je puis être utile——</i>"
</p>

<p>
The newcomer turned at the words, and beamed
at sight of a compatriot.  He was youngish, between
thirty and forty, Simone thought.  He was good-looking,
too; richly dark, as if he might be a child of
the south, like herself.  His eyes were handsome,
and his small features well cut; so were his clothes.
He had a neat, close-clipped moustache, and red
lips which made his teeth look white as he gave
smile for smile, though in reality they were slightly
yellowed by constant cigarette smoking.  Simone
approved of him.  He had the air of being a gentleman,
and she was glad that fate had made them meet.
</p>

<p>
Naturally she knew of the Tsarina pearls, and that
they were expected, after tiresome delays; for Juliet
was both trustful and careless where Simone was
concerned.  But, save for this little comedy, she would
not have met the messenger.  Vaguely the maid
understood that he was private secretary to some
French financier in whose "care" the pearls had been
left; and a secretary was far above a <i>femme de chambre</i>
in the social scale.  It was a pleasant accident which
enabled her to earn his gratitude, and Simone had
a sudden vision of being invited out to dine, or go to
the theatre, as a reward.  Who knew how it might
end if she played just the right cards?
</p>

<p>
For a moment the two tossed "politenesses" to each
other in their own beautiful language, the Nicoise
striving to speak like a Parisienne.  But there was no
time to waste before the return of Togo, and after
a few flowery sentences Simone came to business.
"Monsieur has arrived on the <i>Britannia</i>, is it not?"
she fluted.
</p>

<p>
This told, as she intended, that the "mission"
was no secret from her; and the way was cleared
for the messenger.  He showed her a visiting-card,
with which he had vainly tried to impress Huji.
"Leon Defasquelle" was the name Simone read,
and its owner volubly explained that he was awaited
with impatience by the Duke of Claremanagh.
"This Oriental," he went on, with a glance at the
attentive yellow face, "informs me, if I understand
aright, that I cannot see the Duke."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur may have understood Huji.  But it is
Huji who does not understand the situation," smiled
Simone.  "His Grace the Duke is confined to the
house with a cold.  Otherwise he would doubtless
have met Monsieur at the ship.  As it was, he sent
his own man.  Was not Monsieur received by an
Irishman named Nickson?"
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Defasquelle shook his head sadly.
There must have been a mistake.  He had hoped
to find someone who would see him through the
formalities of landing, but no one had appeared.
Possibly this was due to the fact that his luggage
had been placed under the Letter F instead of D,
and so the Duke's man had missed him.  Fortunately,
through the influence of Mr. Henry Phayre
(still engaged in the noble work of reconstructing
devastated France), and that of the well-known
New York banking house of Phayre, there had been
no difficulty with the Customs.  His—Defasquelle's—mission
had for obvious reasons been kept secret
on shipboard, but the object he brought had been
declared, and instead of being delayed at the dock,
he had been aided by the authorities.  It seemed
strange now to meet obstacles at the journey's
end!
</p>

<p>
"Be seated, Monsieur, for a moment," his
countrywoman cooed.  "I will go myself and tell His
Grace that you have arrived.  I am a privileged
person in this house!"
</p>

<p>
Huji had understood not a word of the conversation
in French, but seeing Simone start in the direction
of the Duke's "study," he put himself in the
woman's way.  "Togo say Duke no see any peoples,"
he warned her in his best English.
</p>

<p>
"I will take the responsibility on myself," she said.
"I knew the Duke long before Togo saw either of
Their Graces."
</p>

<p>
With a slight push she passed the boy, and in her
haste almost skated along the polished floor to the
door next that of the Persian room.  There she
tapped sharply, without a second's hesitation, and
waiting for an answer she could hear her heart knock
in her breast.
</p>

<p>
For a long moment that felt longer there was no
other sound.  The silence behind the door seemed
abnormal to her high-keyed nerves.  But suddenly,
as she was about to rap again, the door was flung open.
The Duke stood on the threshold, his charming
brown face less charming than usual, because of a
slight frown.  At sight of Simone he showed surprise,
his scowl having been prepared for Togo.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  Has your mistress come home?"
he asked.  The frown had faded; the voice was kind.
But this change did not deceive Simone.  She was
sure that the Duke was in what he himself would call
a "blue funk," and the fear she imagined brought
back the last picture her mind had made of him.
Quickly she saw the way to kill two birds with one
stone.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Monsieur le Duc</i>," she said in French.  "The
messenger has arrived from the <i>Britannia</i>, and is
being detained in the hall by the Japanese.  He is
very vexed and surprised.  I took it on myself to
tell Your Grace, as I think this is a man who would
go away in anger; and that would be a pity."
</p>

<p>
Claremanagh flushed.  Simone read his confusion.
Pavoya was not to be seen, but she was in the room,
hidden somewhere; there was no doubt of that;
either behind the big Spanish screen, or in the window
recess covered by velvet curtains.  If Simone had
not learned to control her features she would have
laughed.  She knew that the wretched young man
must be thinking, "What shall I do?  If I go outside
this room to meet Defasquelle, someone may walk in
and find Pavoya.  Perhaps it may be a plot of my
wife's, who has come back and seen Pavoya!  Yet
if I receive Defasquelle here, Pavoya will have to
remain hidden, since there will be no chance for her to
escape."
</p>

<p>
It was a case of the frying pan and the fire, and to
know which was which seemed a "toss up".  However,
the Duke made the best of things as they were,
and decided quickly.  "Of course I'll see this
gentleman," he said in rather a loud tone.  "Have him
sent here at once."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bien, Monsieur le Duc!</i>" agreed Simone; then
added instantly, "And the Capitaine Manners?
Is he to be kept waiting?"
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" exploded Claremanagh.  "Is he
here, too?"
</p>

<p>
"He has been here some time," the maid had begun
to explain when Togo appeared, his eye bright with
rage.  This woman had upset his careful
arrangements!  He knew that she had done it to make
mischief.  But now there was no circumventing her.
He had heard the whole story from Huji, and an
elaborate plan to keep Captain Manners contented
in the Persian room was a burst bubble.  Meekly
Togo took orders from the Duke to bring both visitors
to him, Captain Manners first, because he was a
relative, and not more than five minutes later,
Monsieur Defasquelle.
</p>

<p>
"Does His Grace wish me to make his excuses to
the messenger?" asked Simone, as Togo trotted off
to the Persian room.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, go," said the Duke, no doubt anxious for an
instant with the hidden one; and the maid hurried
back to Defasquelle.  In order to ingratiate herself,
rather than exonerate her mistress's husband, she
threw all her charm into the explanation.  In five
minutes—no more!—His Grace would receive
Monsieur.  Meanwhile, was there any information, any
aid, she could give—she who had known New York
for years?  By the time Togo appeared to conduct
the messenger, Defasquelle and Simone had
discovered that they were both of the south; he, no
farther from Nice than Marseilles.  It was when
the very invitation she had wished for hovered on the
Frenchman's lips that the Japanese intervened,
and Simone hated Togo more violently than before.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br>
BEHIND THE BOOKSHELF
</h3>

<p>
"Captain Manners, this is Monsieur Defasquelle,
private secretary to Monsieur Mayen, of whom you
have heard me speak," Claremanagh introduced the
two men, as the messenger came in.  He shook
Defasquelle's hand and gave him one of the delightful
smiles which helped to make him popular with
all types and classes.
</p>

<p>
Jack tried not to hear what Juliet's husband and
the Frenchman said to each other.  Not that there
was any special reason why he shouldn't hear, for
he'd heard Pat groan over the pawned pearls till he
was sick of the subject; and he had been drawn into
the business of trying to get them for Juliet after
Claremanagh left France.  But his part in the affair
was ended, and he felt that Pat would rather be
alone with Defasquelle; that he had been asked to
make a third on the scene entirely through politeness.
Besides, he was grimly conscious that the three men
were not the only persons present.  He was as sure
as Simone had been that Lyda Pavoya listened from
behind the Spanish screen, or the half-drawn green
velvet curtains.  He was angry for Juliet's sake that
the woman should be in the house, and disgusted
that she should be hidden.  Never had he come so
near disliking Pat, even on the day when Juliet broke
the news of her engagement.  But to his own
annoyance, he could not dislike him whole-heartedly.
He even found himself sneakingly half-sorry for the
fellow.  Wondering why this should be, he was roused
from his thoughts by the raised voice of Defasquelle.
</p>

<p>
"But I must beg, <i>Monsieur le Duc</i>, that you open
the box in my presence and verify the contents!"
he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"I see how you feel, but I can't do that, and it's not
necessary," returned Pat.
</p>

<p>
Jack Manners had seated himself on the club-fender
that guarded the fine fireplace.  He had taken
an illustrated paper to occupy eyes and hands, but
glanced up and saw on the table between Claremanagh
and Defasquelle a box neatly packed in some
waterproof-looking material, sealed with five fat
crimson seals.
</p>

<p>
"It would spoil all the fun if I broke those seals,"
Pat went on, in a more human tone.  "My wife
must be the first to open the thing, and see the
pearls.  I'm extremely sorry she's out.  But it
can't be helped.  If you care to wait——"
</p>

<p>
"When will Madame the Duchess return?" Defasquelle
enquired.
</p>

<p>
"That's more than I know.  Not till late, I'm
afraid."
</p>

<p>
"I have made an engagement in a half hour from
now," regretted the Frenchman, taking out his
watch.  "It is an appointment that cannot be put
off, as the person is not free to change from one time
to another.  Monsieur, I urge you to open the box.
It is only fair to the Purser of the <i>Britannia</i>, who kept
it in his safe.  It is only fair to me——"
</p>

<p>
Claremanagh laughed.  "Oh, don't bother about
that side of it!  Those seals alone are a proof that
the packet hasn't been tampered with since it left
Mayen's hands.  You're his secretary, Monsieur
Defasquelle, and he trusts you completely, or he
wouldn't have chosen you, above any one else, as his
messenger.  But I don't suppose he would take that
seal ring I gave him off his finger to lend it even to
you.  He volunteered the promise to me that it
should never leave his hand.  In fact, when I pledged
the pearls to him for two hundred thousand francs,
it was he who suggested fastening them up in a box
sealed with my own particular, private seal."
</p>

<p>
"You are right so far, <i>Monsieur le Duc</i>," admitted
Defasquelle.  "My employer has been true to his
agreement.  For one thing, the ring you had made
for him with the facsimile of your seal happens to be
rather small.  I do not think he could remove it
from his finger if he wished without having it sawed
off by a jeweller."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then!" said Pat.  "There you are!"
</p>

<p>
"But <i>I</i> am not there," argued the Frenchman,
unfamiliar with English idioms.  "Seals can be taken
off and fastened on again, I have heard, without the
change leaving a trace.  I am certain these are
intact.  But, putting aside myself and the Pursuer,
Monsieur would not——"
</p>

<p>
"Rot, my dear fellow!" cut in the Duke.  "I
trust Mayen as I trust myself.  Of course, I know—we
all three know—the pearls are inside that box.
<i>You</i> say you can't wait for my wife to come home.
<i>I</i> say the seals shan't be broken by any hand but
hers.  Let's be sensible!  Manners, come here, won't
you, and reassure Monsier Defasquelle by examining
these seals!"  He snatched the box up from the
table, and held it out to Jack.  "You've got sharp
eyes.  I leave it to you.  Can't you swear that those
five red blobs have never been tampered with, even
by the smartest expert alive?"
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly Jack came forward, and accepting
the box, closely examined the seals.  "I think I'd
be prepared to swear that," he said.  "All the same,
Monsieur Defasquelle is right, in my opinion.  You
owe it to him—to everyone concerned, including the
company who've insured the pearls—to open the
box before you let it go out of your sight."
</p>

<p>
"You're no true friend of Juliet's, to give me such
advice," Pat taunted him.  "And I won't take it.
That's flat.  While as for the seals, look there!"  As
he retrieved the package, he nodded at a ring on
the least finger of his right hand.
</p>

<p>
Both men's eyes went to it; Defasquelle's to note,
perhaps, how precisely the raised design of the wax
resembled the sunken design on the gold.  But
there was a different thought in Jack Manners' mind.
He remembered what Juliet had written him about
this ring.  What had happened between her and
Pat? was the question that flashed through his head.
A few hours ago she had sealed her "secret letter"
with her husband's ring, after some dispute concerning
it.  And now, here it was on Pat's finger again!
</p>

<p>
Claremanagh, unconscious of Jack's disparaging
reflections, began to regain something like his old
gaiety of manner.  "Are you satisfied, Monsieur?"
he asked.  Then, seeing that Defasquelle screwed
up his brilliant eyes in a near-sighted way, the Duke
flung the box on the table, and pulled off the ring.
</p>

<p>
"Have a good look at it," he said, almost forcing
it into the Frenchman's hand.  "There's a safe in
the wall of this room, made by my dead father-in-law,
to keep such things as he didn't care to send to the
bank.  My wife and I are the only people alive
who have keys to it, or know the combination.
Besides, my own man is the one servant allowed
in this room.  So you see, Jack, I don't need to
keep the box 'in sight' after Monsieur Defasquelle
goes."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, he walked toward an alcove at the
left of the fireplace.  It was fitted with bookshelves;
and as Manners' eyes followed Claremanagh he
remembered the secret of Silas Phayre's safe.  Part
of the top shelf had to be pulled out from the wall
(after touching a spring) and then pushed up.
Thus a small steel door was revealed, and could be
unlocked only after a certain combination of letters
had been made.  Jack had not thought of the safe
in years, or glanced in its direction on entering the
room; but now, to his surprise, he saw that the
bookshelf had already been pushed up, and the safe-door
not only revealed, but opened.
</p>

<p>
Claremanagh's back was turned to him, and he
could not see by a change of face whether Pat was
vexed at his own forgetfulness, or indifferent.  But
Jack remembered the hidden fourth person in the
room, and instinct told him that the safe had not been
opened in readiness for the pearls.  There had been
some other motive.  Claremanagh and the Polish
woman had been interrupted in their tête-à-tête, and
it would be characteristic of Pat if an unexpected
rap on the door had caught him unawares.  Could
he have been in the act of giving Pavoya a jewel from
the safe when he had been forced to answer a knock?
</p>

<p>
Luckily, no such suspicion could be in the Frenchman's
head, for he had not seen Pavoya slip into the
house.  Jack glanced at him, and saw that he had
laid the Duke's seal ring on the table beside the
sealed packet.  He was looking at the safe, but
showed no surprise at finding it open.  For him, it
had been prepared to receive the pearls.
</p>

<p>
"<i>There's</i> a good little hidie-hole!" said Pat.
"Now I'll sign the receipt, Monsieur, and you may
go to your engagement with a light heart."  He
went back to the table, took the box, and tossed it
into the aperture in the wall.  Then he closed the
steel door, did something to it which the eyes of
neither man could follow, and pulled down the
concealing bookshelf.
</p>

<p>
A moment later he was scrawling "Claremanagh"
on the paper which Defasquelle rather sulkily put
into his hand.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br>
WHAT JULIET TOLD JACK
</h3>

<p>
At five minutes before five o'clock Jack Manners
entered the Palm Room of the Hotel Lorne.  This
room adjoined the restaurant, and was crowded with
small tables lit by pink-shaded electric candles.
The Lorne was a good hotel, but too stodgily
respectable to be amusing.  As there was no band at meal
times or tea time, its clients were mostly unmodern
creatures with a strange preference for peace and
quiet.
</p>

<p>
It was well that Jack had arrived before the hour
fixed, for at five precisely Juliet appeared.  He had
already engaged a table in a secluded corner half
screened by drooping, feather-like branches; but
his eyes were on the door, and he sprang up as the
tall, girlish figure drifted in between two palms.
</p>

<p>
At sight of his boyhood's love, his heart gave a
bound.  How lovely she was in her sheathlike grey
dress, with dangling silvery things, like clouds of
dawn filming a pale sunrise sky!  Her hat was simple
yet quaint, pushing forward her bright hair, and
making her face look young as a child's—pathetically
young.  Yes, "pathetic" was the word, Jack thought
as he went to meet her, and she came hastening
to him as to a haven.  And "pathetic" was a new
word in connection with Juliet Phayre!  She had
been proud, fantastic, absurd, charming, obstinate,
unaccountable, and a hundred other things, but
never pathetic.  Manners wondered if it could be
the dip of her odd hat-brim which gave her that
look of transparent pallor, and the blue shadows
under her big eyes.
</p>

<p>
There were not many people in the room, as tea
at the Lorne was far from a fashionable function.
Those who were there seemed absorbed, in a tired,
provincial-shoppers' way, in the muffin and tea
business.  Still, Juliet was too tall and beautiful
not to be conspicuous even if unrecognized, and a
few weeks ago no Sunday Supplement had been
complete without her photograph.  The two could
do no more than gaze deep, eyes in eyes, for an
instant, as they met near the door, and squeeze
instead of shaking hands; but all prudence was Jack's.
He saw by Juliet's face that the tea-drinkers were of
no more importance to her than the chairs they sat
in, and he could have kissed the face turned up
affectionately to his—if he would.  But he would
not, and he did not even speak until he had her
seated at their palm-screened table.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jack, it's great to see you!" Juliet said, when
a too-attentive waiter had finished taking their order.
Tears suddenly welled to her eyes.  She dived into a
gorgeous gold mesh bag for a handkerchief, which
was not there.  "Must be lost!" she sniffed.  Hastily
Jack passed his across the table, and had a
heart-piercing impression that he had lived through this
scene before, in happier days.  But yes, of course!
Often, when he was a big boy and she was a little
girl, she had come to him for consolation.  And she
had always lost her "hanky!"  It was then, when
he was about sixteen, and she eleven, that he had
first begun to love her, with a protecting love that
had changed but never waned as the years passed.
Now she belonged to another man.  Yet she still
called to him, across the gulf marriage had made,
for help and comfort!  Jack Manners wondered
what had happened to his red blood, that the pain
he suffered was not more acute.
</p>

<p>
"I'm too sorry for the child to think of myself
just now," he diagnosed his feelings, with the picture
of Pavoya in his mind.  "The reaction will come
by and by."
</p>

<p>
Juliet began at once to pour out her woes, forgetting
to ask what had happened during Jack's visit
to the house—what her husband had said, or whether
the pearls had come.
</p>

<p>
"Pat doesn't love me," she broke out.  "That's
why I'm miserable.  I don't know how to live.  And
I wouldn't have believed it if any one had told
me—except himself."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean that Claremanagh says——"
Jack began to blunder; but Juliet cut him short.
"Not in <i>words</i>, of course.  But I found a letter from
that devil, Pavoya.  It began, 'My Best and Dearest
Friend'.  Isn't that the same thing as telling me?
The woman wouldn't write to him like that if he
didn't encourage her."
</p>

<p>
Jack longed to comfort the girl; but after what he
had seen, he was at a loss for consoling words.  "How
did you happen to find the letter?" he temporized.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it had to do with the fuss about Pat's
seal ring," the girl confessed.  "But first, I'd better
explain that when I was being married, I made firm
resolutions never to mention the name of Pavoya
to Pat.  Emmy West almost <i>dared</i> me to!  And
that alone was enough to show me it would be a silly
mistake.  But one night after we'd come to New
York and were settling down happily, we had an
exciting, intimate sort of talk about our pasts.  It was
a <i>beautiful</i> talk!  And I felt so sure of Pat, I just
couldn't resist asking if he'd ever loved Pavoya.
He swore he hadn't; he'd only admired her a lot,
and flirted a little.  It was nothing at all beside
what he felt for <i>me</i>.  He was so dear that I burst
out about how nasty Emmy West and other people
had been—how unhappy they'd made me, more
than once.  Pat said '<i>Damn</i> Emmy West and all
the cats!'  I <i>loved</i> that!  And while the mood was
on, I asked if he were willing to promise he'd not see
Pavoya in New York.
</p>

<p>
"The minute those words were spoken, I saw a
change in Pat.  He said he couldn't make such a
promise.  There might be circumstances which
would force him to see her.  He wouldn't call on
her, though.  I had to be satisfied with that, and
I was—<i>almost</i>, till one day when I'd teased him to
lend me his seal ring.  It's supposed to bring luck,
you know.  So I thought I'd try it, for bridge.  I
had to wear it on my thumb; it's too big for my
fingers.  I was playing that afternoon at Nancy
Van Esten's.  I had a Frenchwoman for a partner.
I'd never met her before.  Perhaps you knew her in
Paris?  A Comtesse de Saintville: her husband is
on some mission here.  She's a very impulsive
woman—neurotic, I should think.  I didn't feel drawn to
her, because I'd heard she was a great pal of Lyda
Pavoya's: that they went about together a lot.
Suddenly she noticed the ring.  She squeaked,
'Why, I <i>know</i> that eye!  I saw it on a letter the other
day.'  Then she shut up and turned red.  I could
see her colour through <i>inches</i> of powder!  Of course,
I guessed where she'd seen the letter.  And there was
only one person who could have sent it.  Maybe I
turned red, too.  But I pretended to take no interest,
and Nancy Van Esten said '<i>Do</i> let's play bridge!'
</p>

<p>
"I went home perfectly wretched.  Pat thought
I was ill.  I didn't contradict him.  I hadn't made
up my mind what to do.  But one thing I did—I
kept the ring.  Day before yesterday he asked me
for it.  I knew what that meant!  He wanted
to write to <i>her</i> again—perhaps had a letter to answer.
I showed quite plainly that I hated giving up the
ring.  But he didn't care.  He would have it.  The
only sort of 'concession' he made was to say he'd
give it back next day—after he'd finished a batch
of correspondence.  Well, the next day came, and
he didn't give the ring back, though I saw he wasn't
wearing it.  You know how forgetful and careless
he often is!  I was sure he'd left the ring where he
sealed his letters.  He'd promised I should have it
again.  I suppose I had a right to <i>take</i> it, hadn't I?"
</p>

<p>
Juliet paused, her eyes dry now, challenging Jack.
But he did not speak, and she hurried on to defend
herself.  "I <i>felt</i> I had the right," she persisted,
without conviction.  "So yesterday I went into the room
that used to be Dad's den.  It's Pat's den now.  He
wasn't in——"
</p>

<p>
"Did you think he would be?"
</p>

<p>
"No-o.  As a matter of fact, he'd gone to the bank.
You know he works there.  He's quite keen.  He'd
been late about getting off, so he'd started in a hurry.
His desk wasn't locked.  I don't know whether he
ever locks it, because I never tried the drawers
before.  Anyhow, in the top drawer a lot of letters
were tumbled in—letters he'd received, and letters
he'd written—not in envelopes yet.  All sorts of
things were there in disorder—fountain pens, sealing
wax, and—<i>the ring</i>!  It was on an open letter that
lay face up, a letter with a purple monogram of
L.P.  A perfume came up from the paper—a queer
perfume, and the writing—in purple ink—was queer,
too.  I saw the beginning I told you about: 'My Best
and Dearest Friend'—in French.  Oh, Jack, I thought
I should have died.  I almost wish I had!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" Jack scouted her grief.  "If the
letter had had anything in it Pat was ashamed to
have you see, you may be sure even he wouldn't
have been so careless."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't exactly carelessness made him leave it,"
Juliet said, sadly.  "It was trust in me.  He didn't
dream that I—would do such a thing as read a letter
of his.  And I didn't read it.  I didn't read another
word, Jack.  One side of me wanted to, horribly.
The other side was disgusted at the idea—the
stronger side, it turned out."
</p>

<p>
"Good girl!" cried Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do think I was a saint.  But virtue never
has any reward except its own.  I left the ring and
the letter.  But I felt half dead.  I decided things
couldn't go on as they were.  I meant to speak to
Pat when he came home."
</p>

<p>
"And did you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, because he was ill—had a bad headache—the
beginning of a cold.  Or else he was pretending.
I can't trust him now!  But he looked pale and odd,
so I nobly left him alone till this morning.  Then I
went to the study, and asked him to keep his promise
about the ring.  He pulled open the drawer.  There
it was on the letter, as I saw it yesterday.  That
gave me my chance.  I said, 'Pavoya has been
writing to you.  I see her monogram.'  And I
pretended to read, 'My Best and Dearest Friend',
for the first time."
</p>

<p>
"By George!" exclaimed Jack, as Juliet stopped
for breath.
</p>

<p>
"By George, indeed!" she echoed.  "Pat accused
me of being suspicious.  I accused him of being
untrue.  We had a <i>scene</i>!  I never thought I could say
such things to Pat as I said.  The way he took them
made me worse.  He just looked at me in silence,
with his mouth shut like a steel trap.  I suppose he
hates me now.  If he hadn't deserved every word I
said, <i>I</i> should deserve to be hated for saying them.
If he'd <i>loved</i> me, he would have boxed my ears!  I
half expected he would.  But seeing him stand like a
graven image, I turned to leave the room.  He opened
the door for me to go out, and <i>handed me the ring</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You took it!"
</p>

<p>
"I had to, or fling it in his face.  I went straight off
and wrote that letter to you, which I sealed with the
ring.  Then I sent it back to him by Old Nick.  I
haven't seen Pat, of course, since he shut the door
on me.  And I don't know how we are going to
behave to each other when we meet next."
</p>

<p>
"You will behave as if nothing had happened, of
course," Jack said with decision.
</p>

<p>
"That's your advice?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  And nothing <i>has</i> really happened,
so far as you know.  You have no proof that Claremanagh
has broken his word about calling on Pavoya.
And you've seen no letter from him to her——"
</p>

<p>
"Someone else saw his seal!"
</p>

<p>
"The most innocent words may have been under
it.  And you can't blame a man if a woman chooses
to address him as her 'dearest friend'.  At least
you've no right to do so."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think I have?  That's because you're
a man, always ready to defend another man.  And
you don't understand women."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, I don't claim to!  And I do not
defend Claremanagh.  I merely say, give him the
benefit of the doubt.  Only men and women in
melodrama refuse to hear any defense from the suspected
one.  You asked for my advice.  There it is, my
child, whether it pleases you or not."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you want me to be as cool and reasonable
as you are, you've got to stand by me, and see me
through."
</p>

<p>
"I'm neither cool nor reasonable where you're
concerned, Juliet.  But you know I'll stand by
you."
</p>

<p>
"You mean, you'll not go to Long Island?  You'll
stay in New York, and be our guest?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll not go to Long Island—at present.  I'll
stay in New York.  But I <i>won't</i> be your guest."
</p>

<p>
"You're cruel, Jack!  You're selfish!" Juliet cried,
as she had often unjustly cried before.
</p>

<p>
"You know better," he said.  "It is the outsider
who sees the game.  I ought to see it—if I'm to
help.  And I <i>wouldn't</i> be an outsider if I were your
guest.  I've taken rooms at the Hotel Tarascon,
only one street away from your house and Pat's."
</p>

<p>
Juliet was silent for a moment.  She had a hideous
fear that, in her anger, she had flung <i>Her</i> house, <i>Her</i>
money, <i>Her</i> everything, at Claremanagh's stone
pale face.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br>
JULIET BREAKS THE SEALS
</h3>

<p>
At six forty-two the Duchess of Claremanagh
descended from a plebeian taxicab in front of her
pretentious home.  She had sent away her own car,
before going to the Lorne, and though there was no
wrong in her secret, she was weighed down by a sense
of guilt as she went to her room.  This annoyed
her, because the one guilty person in the house was
Pat!
</p>

<p>
She had heard, toward the end of her conversation
with Jack, that the pearls had come while he was
with the Duke; but the girl was too wretched to care.
How did she know that the story about Monsieur
Mayen was not a "fake"?  It was quite possible that
Pavoya had had the pearls for months, and had only
now given them up, under cover of Mayen's name,
and his messenger on the <i>Britannia</i>.  Juliet felt
as Emmy West had expected her to feel: She hated
the pearls!  Whatever the truth was, she could take
no pleasure in wearing them.  All the same, she
<i>would</i> wear them, to show curiosity-mongers that
they were not in Lyda Pavoya's hands.  She would
wear them this very night.
</p>

<p>
She and Claremanagh were engaged to dine at the
Van Estens', and he had insisted in the morning that
he would be well enough to go.  Now, for all she could
tell, he might have changed his mind, and 'phoned
that his cold would keep him at home.  That excuse
should not affect <i>her</i>, however.  If he did not
bring or send the pearls to her room, Simone should
take him a note.  In this, Juliet would say, not that
Jack had told her, but that she "<i>supposed</i> the
messenger had arrived," and she would ask for the pearls
to wear at Nancy's dinner party—ask for them not
as a favour, but because of the right she had, as
Duchess of Claremanagh.
</p>

<p>
"Madame is very late!" were Simone's first words
as Juliet flung open her bedroom door.  "I began to
be anxious."
</p>

<p>
Juliet glanced at her wrist-watch and a French
clock on the mantel.  It was true, she <i>was</i> late!  She
had a new gown which there had been no time to try,
and dinner was at eight.  The girl's nerves, tensely
strained all day, began to get out of control.  She
was "jumpy" and cross as Simone unfastened the
many little hidden hooks and tiny lace buttonholes of
the "dawn-cloud" dress.  Simone's hands were cold
as ice, she complained.  She hoped Simone wasn't
"sickening for something!"  Then, it seemed that
the quaint grey hat had spoiled her hair, which
usually remained in perfect order throughout the
day.  It had to be let down; and being immensely
long and thick, would take twenty minutes to
rearrange.  Never, never had Simone been so awkward!
Her fingers were all thumbs!
</p>

<p>
For a few moments, in her need of haste and her
nervous agitation, Juliet forgot the crying question
of the pearls.  But a knock at the door which
separated Pat's room from hers set every pulse a-throb.
<i>He had come, of his own accord</i>!
</p>

<p>
The blood rushed to her cheeks, and as she turned
to the opening door, she looked gloriously beautiful.
Her eyes met Claremanagh's with the desperate appeal
of a loving, tortured soul, and he was disarmed.
</p>

<p>
"Could you let Simone go for a few minutes?" he
asked.  "I should like to speak to you alone."
</p>

<p>
A few seconds ago Juliet had been fuming because
every instant counted.  But suddenly time ceased to
be of importance.  She didn't care how late she might
be for Nancy's dinner.  She didn't care if she were
too late to go at all!
</p>

<p>
Simone, who knew that things were not as they
should be, expected her mistress coldly to refuse the
Duke.  She was intensely surprised to be sent away
and told not to return for fifteen minutes.  Sensitively
jealous, the maid resented being sent out of the room
for <i>ce traitre</i>, as she mentally called Claremanagh.
What a different scene there would be between husband
and wife if she had betrayed to the Duchess the
secret of the afternoon!  To do so would satisfy her
love of drama, and her pique against the Duke; but
Simone knew too well "which side her bread was
buttered."  For one thing, the Duchess would not
hear such a tale from a servant, even her trusted
maid.  The Duke might be sent "packing" by the
heiress, but so would Simone!  And for another
thing, there must be no possible suspicion when the
"Whisperer" of the <i>Inner Circle</i> whispered next, as to
where the whisper had started.  It would not do for
Simone to know that Lyda Pavoya had called on the
Duke of Claremanagh in his American wife's absence.
</p>

<p>
The instant the Frenchwoman was out of the room,
Pat came close to Juliet.  He was dressed for dinner,
all but coat and waistcoat, and Juliet adored him
thus, in his glittering white expanse of evening shirt.
She had often told him so.
</p>

<p>
"You were not very kind to me this morning," he
said, looking down at her, his face graver than she had
ever seen it before this day.  "I may as well tell
you I was a good deal hurt, and angry, too—though I
haven't deserved too well of you, perhaps.  But to
see you as you are now makes me forget everything,
except that we've been dear lovers, and that you're
the most beautiful girl on earth—<i>my</i> girl!  You look
just as you looked that evening at Harridge's, a
million miles away, in old London—the night before
our wedding when I came in suddenly, and you'd
been washing your hair.  Do you still hate your poor
Romeo, <i>Giullietta mia</i>, or do you feel like forgetting,
too, and beginning all over again?"
</p>

<p>
"I never hated you—not for a minute!" cried
Juliet.  "I thought you hated <i>me</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you were jolly well mistaken," said Pat.
</p>

<p>
They gazed at each other like two fencers, for a
moment; then Juliet sprang up, and held out her arms.
He clasped her, and kissed her hair, her face, her bare
white neck.  Something he held in his hand, out of
her sight behind his back, fell to the floor.  She
started at the sound, and he let her go, laughing like
his old self.
</p>

<p>
"'History repeats'!" he exclaimed.  "Do you
remember the little box I brought you, with its
blobby seals?  Well, I have another sealed box for
you to-night.  You're to open it as you opened that
one, and you will find the same thing inside.  Only,
it will be the same thing with a difference."
</p>

<p>
He picked up the packet from the floor, and handed
it to Juliet with a flourish.  "<i>Voilà, Madame!  Les
plus belles chases, pour la plus belle dame</i>."
</p>

<p>
"The pearls!" Juliet breathed.
</p>

<p>
"The pearls!" echoed Pat.
</p>

<p>
The girl was thrilled.  How could she have hated
the things so angrily an hour ago?  Her whole mood
concerning them and concerning life had changed under
Pat's kisses.  She was going to <i>love</i> his pearls for
his sake, and the sake of their own romance!
</p>

<p>
"Why, the seals haven't been broken!" she
exclaimed, as she took the box.
</p>

<p>
"No, I was determined you and you alone should
do the breaking."
</p>

<p>
"But—didn't the messenger insist?"
</p>

<p>
"He did.  Two can play at that game, though!"
</p>

<p>
"What about the receipt?  I should have thought
he'd object——"
</p>

<p>
"'Object' is a mild word.  I convinced him in the
end, however—if not that I was right, anyhow that
I meant to have my own way.  Darling, this is a
happy moment for me—though I didn't expect to
be happy to-night.  Break the seals.  Open the
box.  And I shall know by your eyes what you
think of its contents."
</p>

<p>
With trembling fingers Juliet obeyed.  Each seal
was so perfect, it seemed a shame to shatter the
delicate eye in crimson wax.  Laughing, she
remarked that it was clear no thief had touched the
box.  Pat agreed, and took from her the waterproof
wrapping as she peeled it off.  Within was a wooden
box, with a sliding lid, such as French jewellers use.
Claremanagh had bought it himself, at Mayen's
request, he explained to Juliet; and the seal (made
also by his ring) which held the cover in place had
been pressed by his hand in the presence of his friend,
the "super money-lender."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, I'm proud of it!" he exclaimed.  "It's a
work of art.  I'd forgotten how good it was.  The
best seal I've ever done, and I've called myself an
expert—a Genie of the ring!"
</p>

<p>
It needed a pair of scissors to loosen the wax from
the wood.  Then Juliet slipped off the lid, and took
from the box something wrapped in a handkerchief of
fine Irish linen.  "You'll find my monogram on that
rag," said Pat, apparently enjoying himself.  "Mayen
would make me wrap the case with the pearls in
something that belonged to me—something that
couldn't be copied easily by a thief.  My hair wasn't
quite long enough to do up a parcel in, and this was
the only other thing we could think of!"
</p>

<p>
While he gaily explained, Juliet slowly—tantalizing
herself—unwound the linen folds.  So doing, she
smelt a faint fragrance of tobacco—Pat's special
tobacco which left its odour on all his clothes.  It had
seemed exquisitely exciting to the girl when she was
engaged to Claremanagh, and it was more so than
ever to-night, when they were having this heavenly
reconciliation—a reconciliation partly due to Jack's
advice and his defence of the Duke.  But it was odd
that the scent should have lasted all these months!
</p>

<p>
Juliet exclaimed over this to Pat, but he accounted
for it by reminding her how closely the handkerchief
had been shut up in the box.
</p>

<p>
At last she was looking at the jewel-case which
had once belonged to the love-sick Tsarina!  It was of
white velvet, creamy now with age, and stamped
with crowns in gold, pathetically and appropriately
dimmed.  The catch was curious and beautiful:
a big <i>cabochon</i> ruby shaped like a heart.  Juliet
pushed it, and lifted the satin lid.  There, on the
cushion, lay the long rope of pearls curled up like
a snake, with the curious diamond clasp for its head.
</p>

<p>
The girl had expected to cry out in amazed admiration
at sight of the wonderful thing—"Claremanagh's
ewe lamb."  She had expected to be
literally dazzled.  But instead, she suffered a shock
of disappointment.
</p>

<p>
With all the will in the world to be pleased and
grateful, she was dumb.  She could think of nothing
to say; and she tingled with embarrassment under
her husband's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Well, darling," he said, after a few seconds of
waiting.  "Don't the poor pearls come up to your hopes?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" she forced herself to answer.  "Aren't
they <i>big</i>?  Aren't they <i>blue</i>?  I never saw any
so-called 'blue pearls' so really blue as these."
</p>

<p>
"All the same, you are disappointed," Pat judged,
his eyes on her face.  "Don't you think by this time
I know your tones and your expressions?  Out with
it, Jule!  Bless you, <i>I</i> shan't be hurt.  I didn't
make the pearls, you know.  And you're a spoiled
pet of fortune, brought up from your babyhood to
play with better toys than these.  You could have
had pearls as big as plums, in a rope to your feet, if
you'd wanted 'em.  Only your taste was too good.
What's the matter with these baubles?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," the girl hesitated, "if I must say what I
think you know I <i>am</i> supposed to be a bit of an
expert, in my little amateur way, it seems to me
these pearls aren't as lustrous as they ought to be.
Perhaps they're 'sick'.  They may need sea-water,
or something.  Yet they haven't the symptoms of
'dying' pearls.  They haven't lost their colour.
They've got almost too much—to look <i>real</i>."
</p>

<p>
"They're real enough!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course they <i>must</i> be.  And the clasp is charming,
isn't it?  An eye made of a blue sapphire, set in
white diamonds, rimmed with tiny black ones; an eye
like the design of your seal, except that this one looks
to the right, and——"
</p>

<p>
"To the <i>right</i>!"  Pat caught the words from her
mouth.  "Impossible!"
</p>

<p>
Juliet stared.  "But it does.  You may see for
yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Good God!"  There was horror in his voice.
</p>

<p>
Juliet could not understand.  This scene began to
feel like a queer dream.  "What is the matter?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Give me the thing!"
</p>

<p>
She handed him the rope.
</p>

<p>
He glared at the clasp as if the diamond and
sapphire eye were a miniature head of Medusa.
Then he turned to her with a dazed expression, still
in silence.
</p>

<p>
"You frighten me," she faltered.
</p>

<p>
"You—you say you're an expert in pearls," he
said.  "How can you tell real ones from false?"
</p>

<p>
"One very simple way is to touch them to the tip
of the tongue," Juliet explained, bewildered.  "Real
pearls are always cold.  False ones can be warmish.
Besides, the surface feels different.  And even if the
weight is right——"
</p>

<p>
"Test these," Pat said.
</p>

<p>
The girl took back the gleaming blue rope, and
lifted the largest pearls to her lips.
</p>

<p>
"They are—false," she gasped, after an instant's
pause.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I am sure."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br>
THE EYE THAT LOOKED TO THE RIGHT
</h3>

<p>
The two stared at each other in silence, and both
were pale.
</p>

<p>
Juliet's mind was confused.  "The pearls false!"  She
tried to hammer the words into her brain, and
understand fully what the thing would mean for
her and Pat.  She thought of Louis Mayen, the
"super money-lender," who had kept the pearls for
months, and supposed that Claremanagh also must
be thinking of him.
</p>

<p>
"What a treacherous, horrible man!" she broke
out, at last.  The Duke stared, almost
stupidly—if he could be stupid.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Who</i> is treacherous—horrible?" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Why, your friend Mayen, of course!" she
explained.  "My poor Pat!"
</p>

<p>
Comprehension dawned in Claremanagh's eyes.
"Oh, Mayen had nothing to do with this!" he assured
her.
</p>

<p>
"Who else, then?" Juliet persisted.  "The purser
on the ship, who had the box in his safe, coming over?
But he didn't have the seal.  Mayen had it.  He—or
his messenger could——"
</p>

<p>
"Put that idea out of your head, my darling,"
urged Claremanagh.  "Mayen had the seal, and of
course it's on the cards that Defasquelle, his
messenger, might have stolen it or had an imitation one
made.  But neither of them had the——"
</p>

<p>
Abruptly the Duke stopped.  He had been talking
fast and eagerly, and he pulled himself up so short
that it was as if he stumbled.  Juliet had been
examining the quaint clasp of the false pearls, which
she still had in her hand, but that shocked pause
brought her eyes to her husband's face.  It had been
pale and strained, but now there was a look upon it
of physical suffering.
</p>

<p>
"You've thought of the one who did it!" she
cried.  "Someone you care for!"
</p>

<p>
By an intense effort Claremanagh seemed to withdraw
all expression from his face.  It became dull,
like a handsome mask.  "I wish I <i>had</i> thought of
any one," he said.  "No such luck."
</p>

<p>
Juliet had pitied him unselfishly at first, for after
all the pearls were his, not hers, and the
loss—sentimental and material—would be very great if the
Tsarina's pearls were gone.  But his look, his
changed tone, and the cloud that seemed to rise
between them like a mist roused her vague resentment.
She felt as if she had tried to comfort him
and he had pushed her away.
</p>

<p>
"Pat!" she exclaimed, sharply.  "It's no use
your trying to put me off.  You have thought who
changed the pearls—or anyhow, of a person who
<i>might</i> have done it.  You've simply got to tell me.
I have a right to know."
</p>

<p>
"My dear child," he protested.  "You do spring
to the wildest conclusions!"
</p>

<p>
Juliet's anger rose.  "The whole thing is wild.
Only wild conclusions are of any use.  If you don't
want me to try and help you, I won't.  But I can't
prevent myself from seeing one thing that perhaps
you don't see yet.  If the real thief isn't soon found,
and this story gets out, there will be some horrid
gossip about <i>you</i>."
</p>

<p>
Claremanagh flushed scarlet.  "I do see," he
said.  "At least, I see what you're hinting at.  If
I purloin my own pearls, and secretly sell them,
while getting credit at the same time for giving
them to my wife, I bring off a very neat coup.
That's what you mean, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
The thing sounded so crudely villainous when
put into words that Juliet was ashamed.  But there
was a fierce light in the eyes which until to-day had
never looked at her except in love—or seeming love.
Juliet would not let her husband fancy for an
instant that he had made her flinch.  "Yes, that's
what I mean," she answered.  "One's dear friends
are capable of any insinuation."
</p>

<p>
"And even those dearer and nearer than friends!"
Pat flung at her.  "Oh, I realize that I'm the classic
target.  A poor Irish peer—the poorest of the
lot!—who dares to marry America's richest girl.  No
beastly trick too vile to believe of him!  Of course a
blighter like that couldn't have married the girl for
love."
</p>

<p>
To hear the words spoken, even in bitterest
sarcasm, was like the prick of a knife.  Juliet had
pushed them out of her own mind so often that it was
sharpest anguish to have them thrust into it by
Pat's adored lips.  If he loved her, she could not see
how it was possible for him to speak like that!  In
thinking this, she pitied herself desperately, and
forgot her own words which had lashed him to retaliation.
She forgot, too, how that very morning her
lips had flung this very taunt.  She had shown him
sharply how much her own she considered her fortune,
her house, and everything he shared as her
husband.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to her that now he was inadvertently
confessing, rather than sneering at possible accusers.
Juliet defended her own attractions pitifully, yet
there was nothing pitiful in her look.  She loomed
tall and aggressive, and cruelly beautiful, with
blazing eyes and cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"A great many men have told me they loved me,
and that no one could <i>help</i> loving me for myself, but
I never believed any of them till I met you; and then
I was a conceited fool to think you could care for
me after Lyda Pavoya."
</p>

<p>
Pat started as if she had boxed his ears: and Juliet,
too, was surprised.  She had not meant to say that.
The thing had said itself.  For an instant his eyes
flamed.  Then their fire died out, and left them cold.
He looked disgusted.  "I told you once that I had
never loved Mademoiselle Pavoya," he said.  "One
isn't used to having one's word doubted.  It's
rather humiliating to have it happen with one's
own wife.  But putting that aside, why not keep to
the point?  Why bring up the lady's name when
we are discussing quite a different affair—the affair
of these pearls?"
</p>

<p>
Out of Claremanagh's coldness a demon was born,
and flew straight to Juliet's heart.  For an instant
she lost all sense of her own love for her husband.
She hated him and wished to hurt him as much as
she could, because it seemed that he had gone out of
his way to hurt her.  She tingled all over with
indignant humiliation.  It was as if Pat had said, "I
happen to be your husband, but you are only a
commoner with no traditions of fine breeding behind you,
while I am a man whose ancestors might have had
yours for servants.  No wonder you have no
intuitive idea of decent decorum."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Is</i> it a different affair?" she cried.  "Or is it one
single affair—the affair of Lyda Pavoya and your
pearls?"
</p>

<p>
Again the words had spoken themselves, but a flare
of enlightenment came with them.  Surely something
had <i>made</i> her speak.  Something which <i>knew</i>
what she hadn't thought of till this moment: that
Lyda Pavoya had taken the pearls.
</p>

<p>
How she could possibly have got them, if they had
ever been in Louis Mayen's keeping, Juliet could not
see.  But she had them—she had them!  That was
clear: and the fact would account for Pat's sudden
breaking off of a sentence.  He had begun to defend
Mayen and Defasquelle.  "But neither one of them
had the——" he had said, and stopped short, with an
awful look on his face—the look of seeing something
which no one else must be allowed to see.  What
thing was there that Mayen and his messenger had
not, which another person might have had?  A
thing which would make theft possible?  A person
who must be protected at any price?
</p>

<p>
Juliet could not guess yet what the thing might be,
but the second guess was all too easy.
</p>

<p>
This time the Duke showed no sign of surprise,
therefore he was <i>not</i> surprised.  He merely looked
more disgusted than before, which made his lack of
love for his wife and his wish to defend the Polish
dancer more evident to Juliet's racked mind.
</p>

<p>
"When I gave you my word about not loving
Mademoiselle Pavoya I gave it also about the pearls,"
Claremanagh said.  "I told you then that she had
never had them.  I can only repeat the statement,
since you seem to have forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"I have forgotten nothing!" cried Juliet.  "It's
a man's code of honour, I suppose, to defend a
woman, no matter how.  But if that's not so—if
you don't care enough for Lyda Pavoya to lie for her
to your wife, I'd like to know how you'll answer this
question: Do you swear that you don't suspect her
of somehow stealing the real pearls, and putting
imitation ones in their place?"
</p>

<p>
Claremanagh's face changed.  He had been frankly
though coldly furious.  Now he looked stricken.  "I
would lie for no one on earth, except for you, and then
only to save your life," he said.  "It's an insult from
you to me to ask that I should swear such a thing.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then, your simple word is enough,"
said Juliet.  "Give it that you don't think Pavoya
has the pearls."
</p>

<p>
Claremanagh was silent, his eyes upon her.  And
in that silence, short as it was, Juliet heard a tiny
voice speak.  It whispered: "The thing Pavoya
had, which the other didn't have, was a <i>copy</i>.  <i>She
had a copy of the pearls</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I could not believe such a thing," the Duke
answered.  "I have known Mademoiselle Pavoya
for years.  She is a good woman."
</p>

<p>
Juliet laughed, and laughing flung the false pearls
on the floor.  "'A good woman!'  You <i>have</i> original
ideas!  I've heard a lot of things about her from a
lot of people, but never that before."
</p>

<p>
"Because only malicious speeches are amusing,
they are the ones 'a lot of people'—the lot we
know—mostly make."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!" sneered Juliet.  "I see the whole thing
now—except how she got the real pearls.  But this
imitation rope she <i>had</i>.  You can't face me, and say
she hadn't."
</p>

<p>
"I'll say nothing more on the subject while you're
in this mood," returned Claremanagh.
</p>

<p>
"All right, if you think prevarication more
honourable than lying straight out," panted Juliet,
holding down sobs.  "But you won't do her any good with
me—or yourself either.  You were scared <i>blue</i> when
I said the eye of the clasp looked to the right instead
of to the left, like the eye on your seal ring.  You'd
hardly believe it till you <i>had</i> to.  Then the whole
thing grew clear to you, as it's growing for me now.
This copy existed.  The clasp was made the wrong
way, by mistake or on purpose.  As soon as I spoke,
you <i>knew</i> what had happened.  Your first thought—as
soon as you could think—was to save that woman.
But you shan't save her!  I——"
</p>

<p>
"Do you intend to make a scandal of this beastly
business?" the Duke cut her short with violence.
"If you do, you will repent it all your life."
</p>

<p>
Juliet quivered.  "I don't care about my life
now," she said.  "You've spoilt it.  You couldn't
punish me any more than you've punished me
already—for loving and trusting you.  So it doesn't
matter what I——"
</p>

<p>
"It matters immensely," he broke in again.  "You
are cruel to yourself—to me—to a woman who has
<i>never</i> injured you.  When I say that you'll repent
making a scandal, I don't mean because I'd try to
'punish' you.  My God, no!  You'll repent because
you will be doing a great injustice which can't
possibly be repaired.  And at heart, when you're true
to yourself, you are just."
</p>

<p>
"It's no use your trying to appeal to my sense
of justice," Juliet warned him.  "That's the last
thing for <i>you</i> to bring up!"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her very sadly, very strangely, it
seemed to his wife, as if anger were dying out, and
a great sorrow had taken its place.  But that was
only his cleverness—his deadly, Irish cleverness, of
course!
</p>

<p>
"What, then, do you intend to do?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Once more confusion fogged the girl's brain, a
desolate confusion like chaos after ordered beauty;
the end of all joy, all loveliness.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know yet," she said, dully.  "I shall have
to think."
</p>

<p>
As Juliet spoke, fingers tapped lightly on the door:
Simone's fingers, no doubt.  Her fifteen minutes of
banishment had passed.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!"  Juliet spoke mechanically; and if she
wished to withdraw the words, it was too late.  The
Frenchwoman opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Madame la Duchesse</i> is ready for me to finish
dressing her?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Vaguely it struck Juliet that Simone's voice was
not quite natural.  She had probably been listening
at the keyhole, and had heard everything.  But, on
second thoughts, what <i>did</i> it matter?  Juliet told
herself miserably that nothing could be the same as
it had been.  She could not go on after this, living
with Pat as his wife.  All the world would soon know
that there was trouble between them, and Simone's
knowing first was of little importance.  She was only
a servant, and luckily a loyal and discreet servant.
</p>

<p>
As Juliet paused a second before speaking,
Claremanagh answered for her: "The Duchess is feeling
very tired, and as you know, I'm not well.  We've
about decided to telephone that we can't go out,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"But not <i>quite</i> decided," his wife amended.  "I
think that if you prefer to stay at home, I shall go
and make your excuses in person."
</p>

<p>
Pat showed surprise.  He had taken it completely
for granted that she would not dream of dining at
the Van Estens'.  "No," he decided, after an instant's
thought.  "If you are equal to it, so am I."
</p>

<p>
"He's afraid to trust me alone," Juliet told
herself, "for fear I shall say something."  "Very well,"
she said aloud.  "You better hurry up and get ready,
then.  We're late as it is."
</p>

<p>
Pat did not answer.  Without another word or
look he went to his room and shut the door between.
Evidently Nickson had not been with his master
to-night.  Juliet wondered where the man was,
and with a bitter sense of amusement pictured "Old
Nick's" emotions if she began a suit for divorce
against the Duke.  She had always liked the queer
fellow, who had been as fine a soldier, Pat said, as
he was an indifferent valet: had liked him partly
because of his thrilled admiration of her.  Deeply
as he adored her at present, however, that love was
nothing beside what he felt for the Duke.  It made
Juliet a shade more miserable than before to know
that the worshipping Nick would soon cease to
worship.  So far, she had kept back her tears, but they
were becoming irrepressible when Simone exclaimed:
"Oh, the wonderful pearls!  <i>Madame la Duchesse</i>
has let them fall on the floor."
</p>

<p>
The current of Juliet's thoughts changed instantly,
and the brimming tears dried at their source.
</p>

<p>
"The wonderful pearls!" she repeated, with infinite
bitterness, sure as she was that Simone had been
at the keyhole.  But the look of pained astonishment
on the woman's face made her wonder if, after
all, Simone <i>had</i> heard "everything."  Perhaps she
had caught parts only of the conversation, and had
been trying to find out "for sure" whether she had
heard aright.
</p>

<p>
Juliet had perfect trust in Simone, so far as
discretion was concerned, but it was within her estimate
of the maid's character that she should eavesdrop.
People of her class did that sort of thing and thought
it no harm.  It made the drama of their lives!
Simone would keep her knowledge or her suspicion to
herself, of course, until whatever was fated to happen
had happened.  Then, no doubt, she would tell her
friends that she'd "known all along."  Still, Juliet
suddenly disliked the thought of being pitied even
by her maid.  Simone was aware that her mistress
had looked forward to getting the pearls.  It was
humiliating that she should have instead a mere string
of wax or fish-scale beads!  If Simone had heard,
it couldn't be helped.  If she hadn't, however, she
should remain in ignorance.
</p>

<p>
"They're not quite as glorious as I expected them
to be," Juliet remarked.  "I suppose it's like that
with everything in life."
</p>

<p>
"But they are very beautiful," ventured Simone
with the privileged air of the old and trusted servant
which she put on like a sort of chain armour at
times.  "Will <i>Madame la Duchesse</i> wear them to-night?"
</p>

<p>
Juliet was taken aback.  She had, of course,
intended to wear the Tsarina pearls.  She had told
herself that she would do so, if only that everyone
should see that she, not Pavoya, had them.  But
since discovering the truth about them—why, it
had not occurred to her that she could wear the
things!  Rather would she have thrown them into the
fire.  Suddenly, however, she saw the matter from
another point of view.  Suppose she did appear
wearing the rope?  To do so would give her time to
think.  And it would be interesting to see Pat's
face when he caught sight of them.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I'll wear the pearls," she said.  "You
know perfectly well I had this shot blue and silver
tissue made on purpose to go with them.  Why
shouldn't I wear them, Simone?"
</p>

<p>
Simone did not answer, because she understood that
no answer was expected.  She <i>had</i> overheard something,
and it was not her fault that she had not overheard
all.  Unfortunately for her the room was
large, and the Duke and Duchess had stood talking
at a good distance from the door.  The manner of
her mistress, however, filled up several aching gaps
in Simone's curiosity; and putting together what she
knew and what she surmised, the maid changed her
mind as to her own wisest course of conduct.
</p>

<p>
She had intended to sacrifice inclination to
prudence, and say nothing to the Duchess about the
Polish dancer's visit that afternoon.  Now, she
decided that it would be best to mention it.  How to
work up to the subject was the only doubt on that
score left in her mind.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Madame la Duchesse</i> is <i>merveilleuse—etíncilante!</i>"
she cried, as she held the rope of big blue beads over
Juliet's head, and let it fall gently upon the
swans-down whiteness of the bare neck.  "Madame was
perfect as a girl.  Now she goes beyond perfection.
Other women are charming—the beautiful Pole,
Mademoiselle Pavoya for instance, but——"
</p>

<p>
Juliet darted upon her a piercing, angry glance.
"What makes you think or speak of Pavoya just
now?" she sharply questioned.
</p>

<p>
"Oh—I hardly know.  Except that she <i>is</i> of a
great beauty, and—in her way—of a strange
attraction.  And then, also, as no doubt Togo told
<i>Madame la Duchesse</i>, la Pavoya called to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Called to-day!" echoed Juliet.  "You don't
mean <i>here</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"But yes, Madame.  Did not Madame know?
I was about to go out with the bulldog.  Being
permitted to pass down by the front stairs, I saw the
lady arrive.  To be sure, she had on a thick
embroidered veil through which, perhaps, many people
would not recognize the most famous features.  But
my eyes are sharp.  And then, her figure!  There
are not two such.  Though, to my taste, that of
<i>Madame la Duchesse</i> is more alluring, more human.
The dancer is a mere <i>sprite</i>!  I said to myself, 'It
must be about the charity performance for the
Armenians that she is here to consult with my
mistress'!"
</p>

<p>
As she thus interpreted her own impressions,
Simone busied herself in getting Juliet's ermine
cloak, which previously she had laid ready on the
bed.  Sometimes, when the Claremanaghs were going
out together in the evening, the Duke came in and
took his wife's coat from Simone, slipping it in a
leisurely and loving way over the white arms, as
if he never tired of touching the adorable creature
who belonged to him.  But Simone did not think
he would come to perform that office to-night; and
besides, she wanted an excuse to escape from her
mistress's great, wide-open blue eyes.  The maid
had taken a tactful way of explaining the dancer's
(possible) motive for calling; because if she dared to
accuse the Duke by a hint, the Duchess would be
bound to stop her.
</p>

<p>
Juliet was struck dumb for a moment.  She would
not have thought, after what had passed between
her and Pat, that she could be surprised by anything
concerning him and Pavoya, but now she knew that
she could be astounded.
</p>

<p>
Pavoya had called!  Togo had let her in, the
traitor! bribed by Claremanagh, who had sunk
low enough even for <i>that</i>!  Still, had Togo let the
woman in?  It was easy to make sure.
</p>

<p>
"A pity I was out," Juliet said.  "I suppose she
went away when she heard that?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Madame, she came in," replied Simone with
the innocence of a child.  "I do not know how long
she stayed.  <i>Monsieur le Duc</i> will tell Madame that.
It was to his study that Togo took her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well.  I can ask him what message
she left," Juliet promptly cut short this confidence.
She had no wish to learn more, and her suppression
of Simone was no triumph of honour over curiosity.
She felt a sick, languid repulsion against the whole
subject, for she knew the worst now, and any further
information would be a kind of horrid anti-climax.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Pat, Pat!" her heart mourned.  "How
has my idol fallen!  And he talked so nobly about
never lying!"
</p>

<p>
That night, when the Duke and Duchess of Claremanagh
came into their box in time for the second
act of "Rigoletto," everyone "in the know" said
"Look!  She's got the Tsarina pearls at <i>last</i>!"
</p>

<p>
And Claremanagh wondered at her.  He wondered
terribly, abysmally, why, after their scene together,
and her threats, she had worn the abominable things.
He had wondered about that ever since, the ermine
cloak removed, he had seen the blue beads on her
neck at the Van Estens'.
</p>

<p>
He ought, perhaps, to have rejoiced at the sight,
for she could not wear a rope of imitation pearls,
and accuse Lyda Pavoya of stealing the real ones.
That would be to punish him less severely than
herself.  Yet Pat was uneasy as well as unhappy.  The
only thing he understood clearly in all the hideous
affair was that—he understood Juliet not at all.  He
asked himself over and over again a question he
could not, would not ask her—what, in God's name,
she intended to do next?
</p>

<p>
All the way home, when at length they were again
alone together in their brilliantly lit limousine, she
did not utter one word, nor once look at him.  She
sat quite still, pretending to be asleep, but
Claremanagh knew that he was no wider awake than she.
A dozen times he longed to speak; but there are some
things a man cannot do.  She seemed to have
barricaded herself behind a transparent wall, through
which he could see, yet not touch, her—as if she had
been a lovely statuette under a glass case.
</p>

<p>
At the house she sprang past him quickly, without
accepting his help to alight, and ran up the two or
three marble steps.  Claremanagh had his key, but
before he could use it Juliet pressed the electric bell,
and Togo appeared.  The girl did not look back
at her husband, to see whether he meant to follow.
And suddenly he did not mean to do so.  He hadn't
been sure, at first, what he would do: but he could
not bear to have her shut the door of her room upon
him, as she surely would.
</p>

<p>
With a gesture he signed to Togo that he was not
coming in.  The car waited, but he said to the
chauffeur in the pleasant, courteous tone which won the
affection of servants, "I shan't want you—thanks."
</p>

<p>
In that mood, he could not make use of Juliet's
car.  He preferred the poor independence of his own
feet, even while he laughed at himself, bitterly, for
so petty a revolt.  He walked to the "Grumblers,"
that one of his several clubs at which he was likely
to meet a man with whom he had business—business
important enough to remember even now.
</p>

<p>
"I won't keep the beastly money on me any longer,"
he thought.  "The fellow shall have it to-night."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br>
THE HOUSE IN A CROSSTOWN STREET
</h3>

<p>
If Simone had not already telephoned to the
private office of the <i>Inner Circle's</i> editor, she might
have changed her mind about going there that night.
She was less superstitious and of harder mental
fibre than most Frenchwomen of the south and of
her class; but after the quarrel between the Duke
and Duchess something within her shrank from
keeping the secret appointment she had made.
</p>

<p>
It was not that she was suddenly conscience-stricken,
or that she thought her mistress had suffered
enough without having the skeleton in the
cupboard dangled in front of the public.  The woman
was incapable of any real love save self love, but
she liked Juliet, and would have inflicted upon her
no great gratuitous pain.  The pain to be inflicted in
this instance, however (as well as other instances in
the past), was not gratuitous.  Simone would be
magnificently paid for inflicting it, and so far as
Juliet was concerned, she could earn the reward
without a qualm.  It was for herself that she
hesitated; and she did not quite know why.
</p>

<p>
That was the trouble!  If she had known, she
could have argued out the two sides of the matter,
for and against.  But it was only a vague sort of
presentiment she felt, that she would somehow be
sorry if she gave this story to the paper she served.
And it might not be a proper presentiment at all,
but only a form of indigestion.  She had (she too
vividly recalled) taken at luncheon three helpings
of lobster salad, a dish which never agreed with her.
Besides, she was naturally excited over her part in
the events of the day.  And then she had telephoned
the office.  She had camouflaged her message, lest
it should be overheard, but what she had said would
inform the editor that she had up her sleeve the best
tit-bit he had ever got from her.
</p>

<p>
To-morrow afternoon the <i>Inner Circle</i> (a weekly
publication) would be on sale, and the "Whisperer's"
columns were always kept back till the latest possible
moment, on account of just such morsels dropping in.
</p>

<p>
But to-night the last paragraphs were to be held
up expressly for Simone almost beyond the time-limit.
She was bound to "make good" or she would
never be trusted again, and if the editor were satisfied
she was to receive exactly five times the sum she
got for more or less valuable items supplied each
week.
</p>

<p>
With a vague, uneasy presentiment in one scale,
and five hundred dollars in the other (notes, not a
cheque; the <i>Inner Circle</i> never paid cheques for
"Whisperer" stuff) the presentiment was outweighed.
Simone had in any case a dinner engagement
which nothing short of death would have induced
her to miss; and the Duchess had not been gone quite
ten minutes when she flew out to keep it.
</p>

<p>
She said nothing to her dinner companion, however,
about the later appointment, and excused herself
early on the plea that it would be "like Madame
to flash in at home, clamouring for her maid, between
Mrs. Van Esten's party and the opera, if only for a
minute."
</p>

<p>
Certainly it was little more than a minute that
Simone remained at the Phayre house after being
brought back after dinner in a taxi.  At the end
of that time she was out again, and on her way to
the office of the <i>Inner Circle</i>.
</p>

<p>
About this place there was always something
mysterious even to Simone's practical and unimaginative
mind, and the private office of the editor was the
heart of the mystery—the inner circle of the <i>Inner
Circle</i>.  For years she had been a highly paid
contributor to the scandalous little paper, ever since
she had entered her first "smart" situation in New
York, and had been approved by a man whose
outward business was straightforward reporting for the
"Society" columns of a reputable daily.  When in
town, Simone had been in the habit of calling in
person instead of trusting to the post, and since her
value had become recognized, she was invariably
received by the editor himself in that very private
sanctuary of his.  Yet to this day she had never
seen his face, and did not know his real name.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Jones will speak to you," was the message
telephoned down from regions above to the amateurish
little reception room, where an elderly, mild-faced
lady in old-fashioned dress received visitors
and tapped a typewriter.
</p>

<p>
But the Frenchwoman was sure that outside the
office HE was other than "Mr. Jones," as sure as
that Simone Amaranthe was at home Simonetta
Amaranti.
</p>

<p>
The editor's private office was divided practically
into two by means of a fixed screen or partition of
match-boarding so high that even if an enterprising
caller jumped on to a chair he (or she) could not see
what lay on the other side.  There was no door in
this screen, therefore no danger existed that the
editor could be "rushed."  Against the partition
was placed a table and a chair of the ordinary
"office furniture" type; and other decoration there
was none.  On the table were writing materials, and
a small house-telephone.  By means of this instrument
one spoke to the Presence on the other side,
and he spoke in return.  That it was always the
same Presence, Simone knew by the voice.  It was
peculiar, mincing, and rather effeminate, and though
she shrewdly attributed this quality to disguise,
it could not well have been imitated by an understudy.
</p>

<p>
This happened to be the first time Simone had
ever been to the office at night.  It was in a cross-town
street, within possible walking distance of the
Phayre house; and this was luck for her, as she would
have taken a taxi with great reluctance.  This errand
of hers was the most ticklish she had ever carried
out, and she could not afford to leave the least detail
to chance, in case a hue and cry should be raised by
the Claremanaghs.  Twenty minutes' brisk walk
brought her to the door of what had once been a
private house, and was now given up to offices.  The
<i>Inner Circle</i> occupied the two lower floors, and above
was quite a well-known, though not very fashionable,
manicurist, Madame Veno.  Still higher, the fourth
(and top) floor was tenanted by a wig maker who
widely advertised a hair-dye "Goldenglints"; and
once, when a wave of rage against the "Whisperer"
swept New York, it was rumoured that both these
businesses were secretly owned by the <i>Inner Circle</i>.
No proof was obtainable, however, and since then
several new managers had come and gone, both for
Madame Veno and "Goldenglints."
</p>

<p>
To-night the whole house front looked so darkly
brooding to Simone's worried eyes that she could
have believed anything of it, especially anything that
was hideous and evil.
</p>

<p>
There were no lights in the windows, and the front
door, always open by day, was closed.  But the
voice which answered Simone's call on the 'phone
that afternoon had warned her that this would be
so, and had told her what to do.  Following
instructions, she descended the steps to a basement door,
and touched an electric bell above which, on a small
brass plate, was the word "Janitor."
</p>

<p>
Two or three minutes passed, and brought no
answer.  But suddenly, as Simone was about to
ring again, the door opened on a chain.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" a woman's voice demanded
through the aperture.
</p>

<p>
"To see the editor of the <i>Inner Circle</i>," replied
Simone.  "I have an appointment with him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  What is your name?" questioned the voice.
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle Simone Amaranthe."
</p>

<p>
The chain fell, and the door opened as if the Frenchwoman,
challenged, had given the countersign.  Simone
squeezed through the small space allowed her,
and the door instantly shut.
</p>

<p>
It was dark in the basement passage except for
the light that came from a room at the back.  The
woman—the janitor's wife, perhaps—had a little
knitted shawl over her head, as though she were
suffering from neuralgia.  Simone could not see what
she was like, whether old or young, except that her
silhouette loomed tall and slender against the dim
light.
</p>

<p>
"Can you find your way up?" asked the voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Simone, "I was told it would be dark,—and
that I must bring an electric torch.  I have
brought it."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Go up, and knock when you come
to the door.  Mr. Jones is expecting you."
</p>

<p>
Simone switched on the flame of her torch, and
went up.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br>
IN JACK'S PRIVATE SITTING ROOM
</h3>

<p>
Next morning Jack Manners was hideously
jerked from sleep before eight by the jangle of a
telephone bell close to his bed.  In self-defence
he reached out and grabbed the receiver, in haste
to stop the din.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" his voice said: but his tone said
"Damn!"  And he was astounded when Juliet answered.
Juliet! 'phoning at this hour!  Juliet, who had been
at the opera last night, as he happened to know,
and who had always loved her beauty sleep, as a
young bird loves its nest!
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to disturb you, Jack," she was saying.
"I suppose you were fast asleep, and you'll wish
you hadn't told me you were going to stop at the
Tarascon.  But I can't help it!  Do you mind getting
up and dressing in a hurry, and letting me come
round to see you?"
</p>

<p>
"Shan't I call at your house instead?" Jack
suggested, wide awake now.
</p>

<p>
"No, I must come to you.  Have you a private
sitting room?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't."
</p>

<p>
"Then take one at once, and be ready to receive
me in it.  Will half an hour be too soon for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," Jack assured her.  He spoke with
the warmth of affection, and felt it.  But that was
all he felt.  The reaction he'd been expecting
yesterday hadn't come yet!
</p>

<p>
He 'phoned downstairs that he wanted a private
sitting room, and breakfast for two, with flowers on
the table, in half an hour.  Then he plunged into
his bath, and as he shaved and dressed with the
haste that knows how not to waste a single step or
gesture (this was characteristic of him) he wondered,
as he had wondered yesterday, about himself and
Juliet.
</p>

<p>
Funny, how he had dreaded meeting her married,
for fear the boiling lava should break through the
cooled crust!  And the lava hadn't broken through.
He couldn't even feel it boil.  Juliet had her old
sweetness, and charm—even more.  She was prettier
than ever, too.
</p>

<p>
He still loved her, of course, only the love didn't
hurt like a wound with someone twisting a knife in
it, as it had hurt when she told him she was engaged,
and on the day of her wedding.  There was just a
gentle, rather interesting pain, like the pain of
remembering a beautiful dream which had broken off
in the midst; and it was no sharper this morning
than when she came to tea with him yesterday.
</p>

<p>
Just to test himself he had gone to the opera, and
stood up (because there wasn't a seat to be had)
in order to have Juliet burst upon him in all her glory,
wearing the pearls, and, perhaps, beaming with
recovered happiness at Claremanagh's side.  Well,
she had come late into her box, and made a sensation.
Everyone had stared at her—<i>and</i> the pearls—through
levelled glasses.  She had been just as
glorious as he'd expected, though she hadn't exactly
beamed.  And he—Jack—had not turned a hair!
He hardly knew whether to attribute this to his
superhuman self-control, or the strong moral barrier
set up between his thoughts and his love by her
marriage.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, there it was!  He was enduring no
Calvary, and his heart played none of the tricks it
would have played once at being awakened by
Juliet's voice, with the request for a meeting alone
with him.  All he felt was sympathetic interest,
and a fear that the girl was coming to say she'd made
a hash of things, in spite of his advice.
</p>

<p>
In precisely twenty-five minutes after the first
call of the telephone bell in his ear, he was dressed,
and criticising the arrangement of La France roses
on the table in his new sitting room.  Sharp on the
half hour, again came the jangling call.
</p>

<p>
"Lady for you, sir.  Says she's your cousin, and
it's not necessary to give her name.  You're
expecting her."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right," Manners answered.  "Send her up
at once.  I'll meet her at the lift."  Which he did,
and got rather a shock at seeing Juliet all in
black—even a black veil.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I <i>ever</i> saw you dressed like that
before," he began, leading her to the sitting room.
"I thought you always hated black clothes."
</p>

<p>
"So I did.  So I do.  That's the reason I'm
wearing them to-day," the girl almost breathlessly
explained.  "I suppose you'll think it's
melodramatic of me, and maybe it is, though I don't
feel so.  I wanted to put on mourning."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!  What for?"
</p>

<p>
"My happiness."
</p>

<p>
If she had been less beautiful, that announcement
certainly would have sounded a melodramatic note—or
else it would have been funny.  But she was so
white, so big eyed, so like a broken lily in her black
draperies, that Jack's heart yearned over her.  She
leaned to him wistfully, as they stood just inside the
closed door, her hands in his; and the man knew
suddenly that it would be perfectly safe and good for
him to take her in his arms.  He held them out,
having dropped her hands, and the girl flung herself on
his breast as she used to do when she was ten, if a
finger had been cut or a knee bruised.  The next
moment she was crying on his shoulder as though
her heart would break, her slim young body an
incarnate sob as it heaved and shook in his clasp.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jack, you're the only one I have in the world
now!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, nonsense, child.  You've got
Claremanagh.  You'll always have him," he soothed her.
"This is some passing trouble.  It will blow over.
Tell me all about it.  But no, first you must have
breakfast.  You haven't had bite or sup, I'll bet!"
</p>

<p>
History repeated itself.  Again his handkerchief
was out.  He wiped her eyes with it.  He mopped
them.  How long and dark her lashes were, wet and
clinging together!  He bent over her, and kissed
her forehead.  It was hot, and she smelled like a
ripe, delicious peach.  But his pulses hardly tingled.
He was too sorry for her, however, to analyze his
own feelings much, or even think of himself, although
after years the Adored One—married, and belonging
to another man—was in his arms!
</p>

<p>
Of course she hadn't had breakfast, she said.  She
didn't want breakfast.  The very idea of it made her
sick.  She had been awake all night, and had been
dressed—without a maid to help her—since seven.
She was just one bunch of raw, aching nerves!  But
somehow Jack was able to soothe her a little, as
Pat, at his best, could never have done, because she
loved him too wildly.  Jack got her to the sofa, her
back to the door, so that the waiter bustling in with
breakfast should not see the tear-stained face.  Soon
there were cushions behind her shoulders; the
blinds were pulled half down; there was a cool, dewy
rose in her hand.  Then, when the waiter had gone,
she was sipping hot coffee with cream in it and (on
one knee beside the sofa) Jack was feeding her with
bits of toasted and buttered roll.  In spite of herself,
Juliet felt better.  She didn't want to feel better,
but she did!  And she had drunk nearly a cupful
of coffee before Jack let her begin to talk.
</p>

<p>
Having begun, however, she told him everything.
It all came out with a rush, and Jack listened in
silence.  Not once did he interrupt, and, fast as
she spoke (she could not control her speech to
slowness), she thought that he was judging, classifying
each incident, considering how one bore upon another.
</p>

<p>
He did not give away his own secret of yesterday:
that he had seen Lyda Pavoya go into the house,
and that he had known she must be hidden somewhere
in the room while he and Defasquelle were in
Claremanagh's study.  There was nothing to be
gained by telling the poor girl that.  She might even
be aggravated, by the additional proof against
Pavoya, into accusing the woman as a thief!  And
the more he thought, the more inclined he was to
advise against an open scandal.
</p>

<p>
"So you see why I wanted to put on mourning
for my dead happiness," Juliet finished.  "You said
this was a 'passing trouble.'  But you can't say
that now, can you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I can and do," Jack maintained stoutly,
for her sake wholly, not for Claremanagh's.  He
began to believe, in his heart, that this generous,
loving girl had been badly "let down," between the
Duke and the Polish dancer.  Nevertheless, it was
still only fair to give "Pat" (as Juliet called him)
the benefit of the doubt, just as he had urged
yesterday.  "You say yourself that, judging from his
manner when the box was opened, and when you
spoke about the clasp, Claremanagh was as surprised
as you were at the false pearls being there."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Of course I don't accuse him of 'stealing'
the real ones himself, as he so cruelly pretended I did.
But he must have had this copy made for Pavoya.
Probably she thought at first that she had the true
pearls, and when she found out how she'd been
tricked, she made up her mind to turn the tables on
Pat.  Or else she saw a way to humble me—his wife.
Yes, <i>that</i> must be it!  I'm glad—glad I wore the
horrid imitation rope last night.  I hardly knew why
I did it, unless it was for a kind of bluff.  But I
see now, it was more like inspiration.  If I choose
to stick to it that I have the real pearls, she can't
get much fun out of wearing them, can she?  People
will believe <i>me</i>, instead of her, if it comes to open
defiance."
</p>

<p>
"It won't come to that, from Pavoya, and it
oughtn't from you, I think," said Jack.  "My
theory is rather different from yours."
</p>

<p>
"What is it, for heaven's sake?"
</p>

<p>
"It's rather scrappy as yet.  But so far, I should
think Pavoya might have been working in a much
more subtle way than you suppose.  I knew that
once, long ago, and again later, there was a plot
to steal the pearls.  Apparently both times it was
got up by Russians.  And you know they were royal
pearls, given by the Tsarina of his day to Claremanagh's
great-great-grandfather.  Pavoya's a Pole, I
believe, but she may be in Russian pay, or under
Bolshevik influence.  It certainly looks, on
circumstantial evidence, as if she'd somehow got hold of the
pearls, either in Paris, through Louis Mayen, unknown
to his messenger; or else, yesterday by some
amazing sleight of hand, while she was in Claremanagh's
study.  If she could have worried out of him
the combination of the safe—and if by some excuse
she induced him to leave her in the room alone after
Defasquelle delivered up the box (we might assume
she came at that time on purpose, perhaps <i>not</i> by
Pat's invitation) she might have managed the job.
Well—but that's about as far as my mind has worked,
so far.  Except that Claremanagh can't be expected
to give the woman away so long as he isn't dead sure
she's guilty—or which he hopes against hope that
she isn't.  He wouldn't accuse her, or have her
accused if he could help it, even to save himself from
your suspicions, which must make him writhe!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you standing up for him?" Juliet asked,
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"No, not especially.  But you've done him an
injustice in one detail, to begin with.  He did not
have the copy of the Tsarina pearls made for Pavoya.
He didn't have it made at all.  It was done before
his day—done by his mother's order.  He told me
the story in Paris, where the everlasting subject was
you—you and the pearls.  It seems that the
Duchess—your Pat's mother—soon after her marriage
received an anonymous letter warning her of a plot
to steal the Tsarina pearls.  It was signed 'A Well
Wisher', and the writing looked foreign, but not ill
spelt or uneducated.  There was a hint that the
plan was Russian, and the thieves would not be
'ordinary thieves.'  Immediately after the Duchess
ordered a London jeweller to copy the rope, clasp
and all.  When it was ready she had the real thing
locked up in the bank.  The copy was so good that
no one except an expert could tell the difference.
But there had been one mistake.  The eye of the
design in the clasp looked the wrong way—to the
right instead of the left.  However, hardly any one
knew which way the original eye turned, so the
mistake didn't matter much, and the family didn't
trouble to have it rectified.  That was a long time
ago.  But years after there came another warning;
and when it was compared with the first the
handwriting appeared to be the same.  This time the
letter was addressed to Claremanagh, who had come
of age and had lent the pearls to some charitable
exhibition.  'Russia will try again to get back her
own.  Take care,' the letter said—or something like
that.  I've forgotten the precise words Pat used.
And it was signed, as before: 'A Well Wisher'.
Now you see what my mind's working on."
</p>

<p>
"I do see," said Juliet.  "Of course, in a way
you make things look better for Pat.  At least, he
wasn't infatuated enough with that woman to have
a copy of those famous pearls actually made for her
to wear.  Still, he must have given them to her—or
lent them."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so," Jack admitted, "unless——"
</p>

<p>
"Unless what?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I know nothing about the lady except what
I've heard—and that she's a dream of a dancer.
But right or wrong, she has the reputation of being
a tigerish young person when her blood's up.  And
it's conceivable she may simply have annexed the
imitation pearls: put them on to 'see how she looked,'
and refused to disgorge!  Claremanagh isn't the sort
of fellow who would be brutal with a pretty woman."
</p>

<p>
"He isn't, indeed!  But, anyhow, he let her keep
the things—and wear them, too; even if she never
had the real ones.  He receives her at the house
when I'm out—when he pretends to be shut up with
a cold.  It must have been arranged that she should
come then, and Togo bribed to let her in.  Oh, it's all
nearly as bad as it can be, if not <i>quite</i>!  Pat doesn't
deserve that his mind should be eased as it must have
been when he saw at the last minute that I was
wearing the horrid false beads last night.  He'd been
in such a state, for fear I'd 'make a scandal!'  When
he saw the rope on my neck, and heard me calmly
accepting compliments on it, I suppose he thought,
'That settles <i>that</i>.  She can't accuse dear Lyda
now!'  But he forgets.  I can find proof enough to
divorce him, without bringing up a question of the
pearls at all."
</p>

<p>
"Is that what you intend to do?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
Juliet threw out her hands in a gesture of feverish
weariness.  "I don't know what I intend," she sighed,
hopelessly, "I wish I could just <i>die</i>.  Then maybe
Pat would be sorry."
</p>

<p>
"That's what you used to say about your family
when you were a kid.  No doubt Pat would be sorry
if you died.  But wouldn't <i>you</i> be sorry—when you'd
divorced him?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care whether I'm sorry or not," cried
Juliet.  "I'm too miserable now to care about how
I may feel then."
</p>

<p>
"That's the state of mind for jumping out of the
frying-pan into the fire," said Jack.  "Listen, my kid,
did you come here to me to ask my advice?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, partly.  Though I wouldn't promise to
take it if it was anything I didn't like.  But mostly
I came for something else."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"To beg you to <i>help</i> me.  Help's better than advice."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to know I'll help you, in any way I
jolly well can——"
</p>

<p>
"In <i>any</i> way?" she caught him up.
</p>

<p>
Jack was slightly startled, knowing Juliet as he
did know her: impulsive, even unscrupulous, if a
thing passionately wished for were to be obtained—like
all spoiled young women, to whom life has refused
nothing.  "Why not out with it at once, and
not beat round the bush?" he asked.  "You've some
special thing in your mind——"
</p>

<p>
"I have," she cut him short.  "But, truly, Jack,
I hadn't when I came.  I was just going to ask for
your advice and help, mixed up together.  You
were to advise me what to do; and then if I wanted
to do it, you were to help get it done.  I've no one
except you to depend on, and you were my only
hope—if I had any hope left—of making things
somehow work out right in the end.  It's you yourself
who has given me the real idea—the inspiration:
the thing to be done.  And if you are the one person
on earth who can do it, the question is—will you?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't suppose a 'question,'" Manners said,
"if the thing is a thing that will <i>really</i> help you."
</p>

<p>
"It will—it will, more than <i>anything</i> else.  But
you might think it—<i>caddish</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't ask me to do it, I'm sure, if it were
caddish."
</p>

<p>
"Well—you see, I'm a girl—a woman.  It doesn't
seem caddish to me, as it may to a man.  But, Jack,
it's to <i>save</i> me!  It's the one hope to make life worth
living—or to know the worst and not wear out my
soul in suspense.  I can't bear suspense."
</p>

<p>
"Neither can I," Jack reminded her.
</p>

<p>
He was sitting beside her on the sofa now, and
Juliet seized his hands.  "The thing is—I want
you to get acquainted with Lyda Pavoya," she ventured
at last.  "To contrive to be her <i>friend</i>, to win
her confidence even if you must make love to her.
Stop at nothing, until she's told you the whole
secret of the pearls.  That secret means everything
to me.  Wrapped up in it is the secret I care so much
more for, the secret of Pat's love—whether it's hers
or mine.  And his honour is bound up with it, too.
Will you do this for me, Jack?  Or is it too much?"
</p>

<p>
Never had Jack Manners thought that he could
pull his hands away from Juliet's clinging fingers,
and push her off almost roughly, as she would have
held him.  But now he did both, before he had
realized what he was doing.  And he even felt a hot
resentment against her, not unlike repulsion: Juliet,
whom he had worshipped for years—Juliet, for whom
his life would have been a small gift!
</p>

<p>
Before he quite knew what had happened to him,
he was standing at the window, staring out.  He had
not answered, had spoken no word.  She ought to
understand that no answer was the one safe answer
a man could give ... "Caddish!" ... She had
wondered if he would "think it caddish!"  Perhaps
women <i>were</i> cads—just naturally.  He had heard
it said that they didn't know the difference.  But
<i>Juliet</i>!
</p>

<p>
Standing there with his back to her, he began to
gather his wits together to face her attack.  She
would reproach him with violence.  He would try
not to be harsh, because she wasn't herself, of course.
He would explain that what she asked wasn't "too
much"; it wasn't a question of quantity but quality.
There were some things a man couldn't do....
</p>

<p>
But she wasn't reproaching him.  She was crying.
God! he had never heard a woman cry as that girl
was crying!  Such sobs would tear her soul to pieces.
They mustn't go on.  They would kill her—and him!
</p>

<p>
He went back to her.  He knelt on the floor, and
drew into his arms the shaken figure, abandoned
among the cushions.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, don't, my dear—my sweet one!" he implored,
awkwardly smoothing the ruffled gold of her
hair.  "Trust old Jack!  I'll do something.  I'll find
out for you.  I don't know how.  Goodness knows
how!  But I'll worm her secret from that Pavoya
girl!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br>
"THE 'WHISPERER' STUFF"
</h3>

<p>
"My goodness <i>gracious</i>!" gasped Natalie Lowndes.
"<i>Billy</i>—wake up!  Have you seen 'the Whisperer
stuff'?"
</p>

<p>
Billy woke up.
</p>

<p>
It was just after dinner, early yet to begin the real
evening at the Grumblers (known to some outsiders
as the "Plunderers") Club; and Lowndes had been
killing time with a nap.
</p>

<p>
"Whisperer stuff?" he repeated, in a dazed,
almost startled way; and when Billy looked startled
he was not at his best.  Some years ago he had been
considered handsome: a big, athletic fellow with wavy
auburn hair brushed back from a low forehead,
reddish bronze skin, and big black eyes like those of
his sister, Lady West.  But the auburn hair had
faded and thinned, growing far back on the forehead,
which had now become unnaturally high.  He was
less athletic that he had been, because his principal
exercise was taken indoors these days, and consisted
of bridge and poker, poker and bridge, varied by
roulette.  His splendid muscular development was
slowly degenerating into fat; and his large face was
all red without the bronze.  His eyes, too, had
changed, and though still big had a goggling
prominence that was not attractive.  This was why he
did not, when startled, look his best.  The eyes
goggled—his wife said to herself—like a pollywog's.
And aloud she said to him: "<i>Don't</i> pretend not to
know what I mean by 'Whisperer' stuff."
</p>

<p>
"I was asleep," Lowndes excused himself, mildly.
</p>

<p>
"You don't need to tell me that by word of
<i>mouth</i>," Natalie shrugged.  "You've been advertising
the fact through another organ.  Besides, you
never can keep awake fifteen minutes after dinner
if we're alone together.  Not that it matters! ... What
I asked was, <i>have</i> you seen 'the Whisperer
stuff' in this week's <i>Inner Circle</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No," returned Lowndes.  "Don't you know
I never read the rag?  I've told you so pretty
often."
</p>

<p>
"Everybody tells everybody else that they never
read it.  Yet I suppose it sells hundreds of thousand
a week.  My copy's just come in.  Jane brought it—and
you didn't hear her because you were snoring.
I thought you might have seen it at the club before
you left, and not said anything so as to make me
speak first."
</p>

<p>
"Why, has the viper got in a dig against us?"
</p>

<p>
"Vipers don't dig.  No, thanks to Heaven or the
other thing, there's nothing on us.  But it's all about
someone you're just as much interested in—<i>more</i>
interested than you are in me, anyhow.  Juliet
Claremanagh."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  Billy sat up straight in his chair, though he
did not seem to be as intensely excited as his wife
had thought he would be.  "Does the pig mention
her by name?"
</p>

<p>
"The pig does not.  He might as well, though, for
everybody will know who's meant.  By Jove, I
wouldn't be <i>Juliet</i> to-night!"
</p>

<p>
"I believe you!" grunted Lowndes.  But he did
not believe her.  He seldom did; and in this instance
not at all, because he was sure she would give her
eyes to be Juliet, just as sure as that he would give his
to be Juliet's husband.  "What's the racket this
time?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll read the stuff aloud to you," said his wife;
and began: "Let's Whisper!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>That a certain foreign gentleman of title, with one of
the prettiest and richest young wives in New York, is
much to be sympathized with, because he has got a bad
cold.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>But—he is to be congratulated on the marvellous
medicine with which he is able to combat this ailment.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>Let's Whisper again!</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>This medicine is worth its weight in gold.  Only
millionaires can afford to take it at home, and alone,
as Louis of Bavaria used to take Wagner's operas.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>We know he was alone, because the pretty, rich young
wife was out, full up with engagements for the whole
afternoon.  And we know he is a millionaire—oh, we
know it in such a simple way!  It's because his wife
is a millionairess.  See?  The 'Whisperer' thought you
would!</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>And now for the Medicine.  That needs another
whisper.  Sh!</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>We spell it with a capital M, because it has been a
royal Medicine since Salome, the daughter of Herodias,
administered it to King Herod.  Dancing is a fine art,
and its greatest exponent at present in our city is fair
enough to cure any King (to say nothing of the lesser
nobility) even if she did not dance for him.  But of
course, the 'Whisperer' is sure she did dance, because
with what other motive should she pay a call of
consolation upon a nobleman with a cold, when his wife was
not at home to nurse him?  Can you think of any?</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>Let's Whisper, that blade is very becoming to tall
slender ladies with white skin and copper hair, even
when they wear thick veils.  Nothing suits them better,
unless it's pale blue, and blue pearls.  But ladies
with golden hair have now taken to appearing in blue
pearls—ropes of them.  The 'Whisperer' supposes they
are real.  Why, certainly!  Could they be otherwise?
Yet, on the other hand, are there two such ropes in the
world?  We shall see.  We may see any day now!
And the 'Whisperer' hopes and prays that if we do see
there won't be trouble.  Both the ladies are so charming.
Pearls are so compromising.  And the gentleman is so
popular.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>Let's Whisper: What a game of Consequences!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"There!" Mrs. Lowndes finished with a gasp.
"What do you think of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Can you beat it?" her husband answered with a
question.
</p>

<p>
"I can't," said Natalie.  "But I guess the Duke
will beat something or someone.  He'll have to."
</p>

<p>
"You mean the 'Whisperer!'  H'm!  Before you
cook your hare, you've got to catch him.  A whole
lot of men have tried to catch that one.  But the
<i>Inner Circle</i> still circulates."
</p>

<p>
Natalie brooded for a moment.  When she was a
girl, in a set that was conspicuous though not first
rate, the "Whisperer" had whispered several nasty
things about her.  He, She, or It had said that she
had come from "Peoria or somewhere" to New York
to buy a husband, and had kindly warned her that
persons not rich enough to pick and choose their
goods had better snap up what they could get the
first day of the sale, at the cheap bargain-counter.
Since she had taken that advice and snapped up
Billy Lowndes, the "Whisperer" had for some reason
been silent; but Natalie had never forgiven or
forgotten the attack on her attractions, and she had
always burned to have some other victim arraigned
for justifiable homicide.
</p>

<p>
"I bet Claremanagh will break the vicious <i>Circle</i>!"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"And I bet he won't.  Why should he bring off a
stunt none of us ever brought?  They say there's
nothing to break.  Some husband or father goes
murder-mad, bursts into the <i>Circle</i> office, and finds
no one on the premises but a little old lady.  Can he
bash <i>that</i>?  Besides, why make a cap fit you by
wearing it?  Lord knows what that d—d 'Whisperer's'
working up to when he hints at the Claremanagh
pearls being false.  But if they are, the Duke must
have sold them himself, and had a copy made—two
copies, perhaps.  By George, I shouldn't wonder if
that's just what he <i>did</i> do!—sell—I mean, Juliet told
my sister Emmy that Claremanagh refused the
million or so she wanted to settle on him, and
intended to join the working classes over here.  He
doesn't get a salary to be proud of, at the Phayre
bank, I know for a fact.  But I've seen him playing
poker at the Grumblers and—er—another game
elsewhere.  Last night he waltzed into the Grumblers
after the opera, and I happened to see him pass a
roll of yellow-backs as big as my fist into a man's
hand.  The other chap dropped the lot, by accident,
and the noble Duke stood still with his nose in the
air while they were collected.  I saw a one
thousand-dollar bill with my own eyes, and I have a hunch
there were a heap more of the same sort."
</p>

<p>
"Who was the man?" Natalie asked, curiously.
</p>

<p>
"I've forgotten his name," Billy evaded her.
"There are a lot of new men in the club lately I
know only by sight."
</p>

<p>
"Tell that to the marines!" she scoffed.  "You've
got some reason for keeping his name dark.  Did
any one else see Claremanagh pay him the money?
Because, if they did, I'll be sure to find out."
</p>

<p>
"I think everyone was pretty busy just then.  I
wouldn't have seen, if I hadn't been cutting out of a
game at the moment.  It's nothing to me who the
man was.  You're always so damned suspicious of
anything I say."
</p>

<p>
Natalie shrugged her shoulders, a favourite gesture.
"But not of what you do, I don't care enough,"
she retaliated, and picked up the <i>Inner Circle</i> again
to re-read "the Whisperer stuff", while she richly
pictured Juliet's feelings.
</p>

<p>
She didn't know the Duchess very well, but she
thought that there would be "ructions."
</p>

<p>
"Pavoya must have been at the house while Juliet
was lunching with me," she told herself.  "I shouldn't
wonder if the Duke <i>had</i> sold his pearls.  Won't
Juliet be <i>wild</i> if she finds out the wonderful rope
everyone was talking about last night was <i>false</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Natalie grew so absorbed in settling just what she
would write to Emmy West that she did not even
speak to Billy when he went out.  She was sure he
was going to the "Plunderers," and she was right.
Nevertheless, she had made one mistake about him.
He had told the truth in saying that he did not know
the name of the man to whom Claremanagh had
handed a roll of notes.  He did, however, wish to
know, and as soon as possible.  But he arrived
to find everyone talking of "the 'Whisperer' stuff"
in the <i>Inner Circle</i>.  Most of the men were defending
the Duke, who had an extraordinary way of making
himself liked without trying; and this vexed Lowndes.
He had a grudge against Claremanagh for marrying
Juliet Phayre, the only girl who bad ever given him
a heartache.  Losing her and getting Natalie had
made him the man he was.
</p>

<p>
"What I want to find out is, <i>who</i> is the chap
Claremanagh paid about a hundred thousand dollars to
last night, here in this club?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"A hundred thousand dollars?" somebody echoed.
"How do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I do know," Lowndes persisted, provocatively,
and made up his mind to stick to the statement.
"I do know.  And what I'd like to know also, in
the circumstances, is how did he get the money?"
</p>

<p>
"Ask the winds!" laughed the other.
</p>

<p>
"Easier to ask his wife."
</p>

<p>
"You believe she knows?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not how he got the stuff.  But I guess she
<i>thinks</i> she knows, which is just as interesting."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Juliet was utterly indifferent that night as to
whether or not her thoughts were interesting to
outsiders.  Pat and herself filled the world for her.
There was no one else—not even Jack
Manners—who existed for her after she had read the
"Whisperer": except Lyda Pavoya.  But the Polish dancer
was not for Juliet a fellow-being.  She was a
Lure-light, a Mermaid, a Siren.
</p>

<p>
Simone was in the habit of buying the <i>Inner Circle</i>
for the Duchess on the day of publication.  She
had never been ordered to do this, but her mistress
in the last place she had filled in New York had
expected the "rag" to appear in her boudoir as soon
as it was on sale, and Simone (with a certain cynical
enjoyment) had unobtrusively supplied the paper
to Juliet without being asked.
</p>

<p>
It was a disgrace to New York, and utterly disgusting
and unreliable, of course, and Juliet scorned
it as a horrid beast.  All the same, she read it every
week before flinging it on the floor or pitching it into
a wastepaper basket.  Sometimes she was angry
at its nasty digs at people she knew; sometimes she
chuckled (one <i>had</i> to!).  As her car took her home
from Jack Manners' hotel she suddenly remembered
that it was <i>Inner Circle</i> day.
</p>

<p>
Could that fiend of a "Whisperer" have got hold
of anything new about Pat and Pavoya?  Juliet
could not see that this was possible.  But there
was almost sure to be some mention of the blue pearls
she had worn at the opera, unless the news had been
too late for press.  She was so miserable already that
she wondered at herself for feeling so small a prick
in the midst of a deep and all-pervading pain.  Yet
she was conscious of uneasiness, and it remained in
the back of her mind throughout the day.
</p>

<p>
She had not expected to see Pat at luncheon, and
if she had seen him, she would have suffered
disappointment.  Whether he were merely resentful against
her for the things she had said to him, or whether
he were ashamed to face her because he had lied,
and she knew it, Juliet could not tell.  In his
absence, he was as vitally present as if she saw him
before her eyes.  Indeed, she did see him—with Lyda
Pavoya.  It seemed certain that he must have gone
to Lyda, if only to demand some explanation of
what had happened to the pearls.  And it was
conceivable that, if he were convinced she had robbed
him, he might have a reaction of feeling against the
woman.  In such a case, he would perhaps return
and implore his wife to forgive him.
</p>

<p>
As she thought this, Juliet hardened her heart
against his charm, his magnetism which she knew
to be almost irresistible.  She <i>would</i> resist it!  It
would be ridiculous to let herself be cajoled by Pat's
Irish ways.  He would laugh in his sleeve if he could
persuade her that he had never loved Pavoya.
</p>

<p>
But the day wore on, and he did not come home.
</p>

<p>
All she knew about him was that he must have
spent some late part of the night in the house,
because Simone had casually mentioned an early
meeting in the hall as he went out, about nine in the
morning.  He had handed the maid a few letters,
which he said were for the Duchess to read and
attend to, rather than for him.  That was all.  And
though Juliet did not mean to pardon him, she would
have given the price of the lost pearls to be begged
for her forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
Now and then, like a faint undertone in wild
music, returned the thought of the <i>Inner Circle</i>,
and at the time when it should be lying on a certain
table in her boudoir, Juliet looked for it.  The
paper was not there!
</p>

<p>
She had come in from her bedroom, a wrapper
thrown over her nightgown, for she was pretending
to have a headache, and had gone to bed on returning
from the Tarascon, as an excuse for throwing over
all engagements.
</p>

<p>
"There's something horrid about Pat or me in the
rag," she guessed instantly.  "Simone's read, or
heard about it, and means to 'forget' the paper."
</p>

<p>
It would not be pleasant to ask, but after all
Simone was only a servant!  Juliet rang the bell
communicating with her maid's room, and soon the
neat figure in black presented itself.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Madame la Duchesse has rung?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Where is that horrid <i>Inner Circle</i>?" the Duchess
inquired.
</p>

<p>
Simone looked self-conscious.  She said that,
Madame being <i>souffrante</i>, she had forgotten to buy
the paper.  It was of so little importance!  But
Juliet would not be put off.  The Frenchwoman was
sent out to get the <i>Inner Circle</i>, and when she had
got it, was told that she would be needed no more
for the moment.  Therefore Claremanagh's wife was
alone when she read the "Whisperer's" insinuations.
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough—or was it strange?—her anger
turned in a torrent-flood against the man who ran
the rag.  None was left for Pat.  Juliet burned for
him to come home so that they could—even if "on
official terms only"—join together in scotching this
scandal.  She felt that she must see her husband at
once.  But she could not send for him without being
misunderstood.  If she were able to reach him by
'phoning to one of his clubs, he would think that he
was being called back to a scene of reconciliation
because his wife was too much in love to live without
him for more than a day.  No! even though her
rage was too concentrated in another direction to blaze
upon Pat, she didn't wish him to think that he was
forgiven.
</p>

<p>
Again Jack Manners seemed her best hope, and
she 'phoned him at the Tarascon.  He was out, the
answer came, and Juliet asked that the Duchess of
Claremanagh should be called up as soon as he came
in.
</p>

<p>
An hour later the bell of her telephone jingled.
Jack had returned to his suite at the Tarascon.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you'd never come!" she complained.
</p>

<p>
"But," he excused himself, "you gave me a mission.
I've been doing my best to pave the way."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you've met Pavoya?'
</p>

<p>
"Not yet.  But I shall meet her to-night.  She's
dancing, you know.  Or—why should you know?
An old friend of mine—and hers, too—has arranged
an introduction.  That's the only news I have for
you, so far."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't ring you up to ask for news," said his
cousin, though her quick brain caught at a welcome
deduction: if Jack were to meet Pavoya at a party
or something, it did not look as if Pat had pardoned
her for the pearls.  Otherwise they would be
together.  "I want you to see Pat for me," Juliet
went on.  "Not to make it up!  When you find him,
tell him <i>that</i> to begin with, please.  But he and I
must meet, and talk over this horrible 'Whisperer'
business.  I don't want a scandal—anyhow <i>that</i>
kind!—any more than he does.  Tell him it's cowardly
to run away and stay away like this.  It makes
things worse.  Tell him he must come home—or
bring him."
</p>

<p>
"I can't put things to Pat in that way, but I'll
see him if you wish," answered Jack.  "Where is
he?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."  (Juliet's voice sounded disconsolate
and very young, even through the 'phone.)  "At
some club, I suppose.  Do call me when you've
found him."
</p>

<p>
It was seven o'clock....  After three more
hours of suspense Juliet rushed to the telephone
at first sound of the bell.  If it were not Jack—or
Pat—she should scream.  But it was Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I can't find Claremanagh anywhere, or hear of his
movements since two o'clock," Manners said.  "He
was then at a club you probably never heard of.
It's called 'The Joint'.  All sorts of men belong—actors,
writers, lawyers, sportsmen, and at least one
private detective!  Pat isn't a member.  I shouldn't
have thought of the place if a man I know (the one
who will introduce me to Mademoiselle Pavoya)
hadn't mentioned seeing Pat there this morning with
two men.  That's why I went round, after I'd tried
everywhere else.  Well, he was there at five, with
the detective I spoke of just now, and a Frenchman
named Defasquelle.  That name will strike
you!  He had an appointment to come back and
dine with Defasquelle who, it seems, came with an
introduction and has been made a foreign member.
In fact, he's staying at the club, and I have been
talking with him.  In the hope of seeing Pat at eight,
I waited, because Defasquelle was so sure he would
come.  But at half-past nine he hadn't turned up.
I've 'phoned everywhere I can think of since, and
left word that I'm to be called whenever there's news,
no matter what time.  When I go out—as I must
do if I'm to meet the <i>lady</i>—I shall leave my address
with the Tarascon people."
</p>

<p>
"What can have happened to Pat!" Manners
heard Juliet cry.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry.  He's certain to be all right,"
Jack assured her.  But he wasn't quite comfortable
upon that point himself and had quietly 'phoned
all the hospitals.  It looked queer that Claremanagh
hadn't kept that engagement with Defasquelle.  He
had apparently been anxious to keep it.  If there
had been an accident to a man so well known, surely
the news would have got into the evening papers.
Yet there was no news anywhere of any kind, since
the Duke had walked out of "The Joint" at five.
Were such a thing not too absurdly far-fetched,
Jack would have asked himself if any one existed
who might wish Claremanagh to disappear?

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br>
A WOMAN'S EYES
</h3>

<p>
"Mademoiselle Pavoya, this is Captain John
Manners, just back from France: a cousin of the
Duchess of Claremanagh's," said the manager who
was introducing Jack.
</p>

<p>
Lyda Pavoya lifted her drooping head a little—only
a little, and fixed upon Manners a pair of dark
eyes.  "A pair of dark eyes!"  Simple words, and
a simple act.  There are many women in the world
with dark eyes, and many had looked at John
Manners.  But these eyes of the Polish woman——!
</p>

<p>
As they gave that upward look from under heavy
lashes Manners felt himself a traitor.  He had heard
all sorts of stories about Lyda Pavoya.  He had got
an impression that she was a "tigress woman."  And
then, the dancing that he had seen her do was wild
and barbaric.  But to-night she was a swan.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were dark, but not black or even brown.
They were perhaps a very deep, greenish grey, and
extraordinarily luminous.  Yes, that was the word:
luminous!  "Brilliant" would be too hard.  There
was a mysterious, moonlight sort of luminance
between the black fringes of the white lids, and the
whole face—pale, delicate, with pointed chin—was
mysterious as only Polish or Russian faces are.
</p>

<p>
"Why does she look at me so?" Jack thought.  It
was almost as if she guessed, because he was Juliet's
cousin, why he had asked for this introduction.
He could not believe that she, who met so many
people, could recognize the man in evening dress
as the officer in khaki she had seen on the Phayre
doorstep.
</p>

<p>
They were in a room at the theatre where Mademoiselle
Pavoya received privileged persons: a plainly
furnished room, mostly grey except for masses of
flowers, and it suited her better than a background
of fantastic colour.  Perhaps it was this greyness
which made her stand out so vividly, and seem of
such vital, thrilling importance.  She was extremely
quiet in manner, and her voice was low.  Yet her
quietness was disturbing, like that of a summer
night when lightning may leap from a clear sky.
</p>

<p>
Manners was struck dumb by her.  Something
had flashed from her eyes to his with that first look.
It did not say merely, "I am a woman.  You are a
man."  It said—or seemed to say—"You are <i>the</i>
man.  I am <i>the</i> woman.  We had to meet.  And
now—what?"
</p>

<p>
He tried to think that this was a trick of hers which
she used on every male worthy of her steel.  But
he could not believe it to be so.  Her perfume—that
perfume of an Eastern garden by moonlight—had
gone to his head.  No woman had ever produced
such an effect upon him, though they had exchanged
but a few words, and those not memorable.  Yet he
was not humiliated by his own surrender.  In
spite of all reason he was convinced that she had been
stirred by him as he by her.
</p>

<p>
The meeting was between Pavoya's dances, and
she had not many minutes to spare.  Her manager
had impressed upon Manners that the few she gave
were an immense concession.  There was no hope of
prolonging them.  Her call came.  She had to go.
Again eyes met with that shock to the nerves.
Suddenly Lyda held out her hand to Jack.  Clasping
it, electricity flashed up his arm and stabbed at
his heart.  He felt her start slightly, and his breath
quickened.
</p>

<p>
For Juliet's sake, and the promise he had made,
it was Manners' duty to take instant advantage
of his "luck" with Pavoya.  But he was not thinking
about Juliet—or the promise.  He was neither
remorseful nor triumphant.  All he thought of or
wanted as they talked in snatches was to hold this
woman, not to let her go till he had arranged to meet
her again.  He must meet her again!  He must know
what she really was—what they were to be in each
other's lives.  But he could not ask permission
to call.  He was stupidly tongue-tied, and could not
put words together as he would have wished.
</p>

<p>
"Would you care to have supper with me at my
house to-night?" she asked, not taking her hand
from his.
</p>

<p>
The invitation was so unexpected that Jack could
hardly believe it had been given.  Yet he heard
himself answering, "Yes, I should be delighted."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad," she said, in her perfect English, with
the pretty accent that was part of her charm.
"Perhaps you don't know where I live?  I have
taken a house, furnished: Mrs. Lloyd-Jackson's
house on Park Avenue.  You have been there?
Supper will be at twelve.  Till then——"
</p>

<p>
She was gone.
</p>

<p>
"By Jingo, you've made a hit, my boy!" chuckled
Pavoya's manager.
</p>

<p>
It was all Jack could do to detach himself from
thoughts of Lyda, and go about Juliet's business
between ten-forty and midnight.  For the first time
in his life the prospect of seeing Juliet was distasteful
to him.  He didn't want to see her, because she would
ask him about Lyda Pavoya, and in his present mood
there was nothing he would hate worse than discussing
the Polish girl with his cousin.  But he was as
sorry for Juliet as ever, and just as anxious to help
her.
</p>

<p>
Desperately against the grain, he took a taxi and
drove to the Phayre house, which he found brilliantly
lighted.  The huge front looked so gay that for a
moment he hoped Pat had come back.  But he
asked for the Duke, and was told gravely by Togo
that His Grace was not at home.  The Duchess,
however, was expecting Captain Manners.
</p>

<p>
Juliet was waiting, not in her boudoir, but in the
Chinese room which her father had loved.  She no
longer wore the dressing gown she had put on when
nursing her headache in the afternoon, but was
dazzling in some flame-coloured film over shot gold and
purple tissue.
</p>

<p>
"You've had good news!" Jack exclaimed at
sight of her.
</p>

<p>
"No, I've had none whatever," she said.  "If
possible, things are worse.  I know why you thought
something good had happened.  All the lights, and
this dress!  But if you were a woman you'd understand.
I've realized that there's a fight in front of
me.  I want it to be a silent battle.  I don't wish
people to know I'm fighting at all—till I see what
the end's likely to be."
</p>

<p>
"I do understand," Jack said.  "You're a brave
girl, and I believe the end will be all right."
</p>

<p>
He hurried on to talk about Pat, and thus put off
the bad moment when she would question him about
Pavoya.  As nothing had been heard of the missing
one and Juliet seemed now even more anxious than
angry, Jack decided to confess having telephoned
to all the hospitals.  It was good news, he insisted,
that these enquiries had drawn blank, and he did
his best as a comforter by saying that Pat had probably
gone off in a huff.  People who loved each other
flew into rages more easily than those who didn't
care.  Men of Pat's temperament didn't lie down
quietly to be trampled on by their wives.  He'd write
soon, or send word somehow when his first fury had
exploded.  Or, at worst, he would communicate
with the bank, even if he didn't turn up for work
there.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, however, Jack admitted that they
mustn't let things slide and merely "hope for the
best."  Would Juliet like to have a detective
engaged—a private one, of course—quietly to make
enquiries, in the very unlikely case that something
queer had happened?
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I was going to suggest that," Juliet said in a
hard, bright voice which kept back tears.  "What
about that detective you spoke of—the one who was
with Pat and Defasquelle at the club?"
</p>

<p>
Jack hesitated.  "Well, I think we'd better get a
chap of our own.  You see, possibly <i>he</i> was Pat's
man, engaged for the—the pearl business.  He
mightn't be able to work for us with a whole
heart——"
</p>

<p>
"I know what you mean," Juliet caught Manners
up.  "Pat's man may know where Pat really is,
and lead us off the track, instead of on to it."
</p>

<p>
"It's just possible," Jack had to agree.
</p>

<p>
"Would you believe it," the girl veered abruptly
to a new subject, "two reporters have called to
interview me about the <i>Inner Circle</i> stuff?"
</p>

<p>
"Impudent beasts!" Manners lashed out.  "Of
course you didn't receive them?"
</p>

<p>
"Jack, I <i>did</i>!" said Juliet.  "I'll tell you why.
Here in the house I've got more and more proof
against Pat—or against <i>that woman</i>."  Jack winced,
but she was not looking at him: her eyes were full
of tears.  "Still, I'm doing what you told me to do:
I'm giving him 'the benefit of the doubt.'  Besides—I've
my pride, just as Pat has his.  There's my
father's name.  In its way that's as good as the
name of Claremanagh, or all the dukes in Britain.
I came to this room to-night because Dad loved it so,
and I felt as if he were here in spirit, helping me to be
strong.  He was such a busy man, yet always he had
time for me!  I can almost hear his voice saying,
'Steady, Jule!' as he used to say when I was in one
of my wild moods.  I had those newspapermen
brought to me here.  And I said to one what I said
to the other.  I admitted that I'd seen the <i>Inner
Circle</i>, and I supposed the horrid rag meant <i>us</i>.  But
I simply laughed at the whole thing!  I told them
Pavoya came to see <i>me</i>—something about her dance
for the Armenians: you know, the roof-garden show
Nancy Van Esten's getting up.  I said the insinuation
about the pearls was nonsense: that I'm an expert,
and that they're the realest things I ever saw.
I talked about Pat as if we two were the best of
friends, and mentioned just casually that he was
away for a few days.  I was as nice as I could be to
the men, though I longed to—to <i>kick</i> them!  I'm
sure they both went off to their horrid old newspapers
to write beautiful things about the family.  Don't
you think I did right?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," said Jack.  "If you don't mind being
a bit <i>infra dig</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind anything," Juliet choked, "if only
Pat comes back safely and—and—if we can patch
up some sort of a life together.  If—I don't have to
break with him."
</p>

<p>
"Then you've given up those ideas you had this
morning?"
</p>

<p>
"About divorce?  No.  I haven't exactly given
them up.  But they seem far off now—when I'm
so afraid for Pat.  I've thought of a thousand things
that might have happened to him.  Suppose he <i>does</i>
love me really, and Pavoya is jealous?  She'd be
capable of <i>anything</i>.  She may have had him stabbed!
That reminds me: you've met her?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you want me to say?"
</p>

<p>
"To tell me what she was like, of course!  How
you got on—what have you got out of her?"
</p>

<p>
Jack felt suddenly antagonistic to Juliet.  "I
was with Mademoiselle Pavoya about twenty minutes
at most, and her manager was there, too," he
said.  "I got nothing out of her.  What did you
expect?  All the same you may take it from me,
Juliet, you'll make a big mistake if you imagine she
has anything to do with Pat's not showing up.  I'm
sure she hasn't."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  She's hypnotized you, too, has she?"
snapped Juliet.  "Pat wanted to make me believe she
was a <i>good woman</i>!  Come with me into his study,
and I'll show you something.  Then perhaps you
won't be so quick to defend her!"
</p>

<p>
This was worse than Jack's fears.  He couldn't
refuse to follow his cousin.  From everyone's point
of view, that would be poor policy.  But he hated
to go to Pat's study.  He did not wish to see
anything Juliet had to show him there.
</p>

<p>
"If it's a letter, I won't——" he had begun when
she cut him short.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't a letter!  After the scolding you gave me
at the Lorne, I wouldn't glance at the <i>wildest</i>
love-letter of Pavoya's even if she'd <i>printed</i> it so large I
could read every word across the room."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't give you a scolding," Jack defended himself.
"I only said a <i>man</i> wouldn't do what you did—or
some such thing as that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That's just what you did say."  Juliet
was unlocking the door of Pat's study, of which she
had the key.
</p>

<p>
"I never knew you not to do what you wanted
to do because I or any one else scolded you!"
</p>

<p>
"How hard you are to me, Jack!" she reproached
him.  "This is different.  And <i>I</i> am different.  I
don't want to do anything a man would think mean.
I want to be fair to Pat, whatever happens.  But
about the pearls I can't be fair to him and Pavoya
both.  I'm going to show you why not."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke she went to Pat's desk, where things
were wildly scattered, as in his notorious carelessness
he had left them.  Jack Manners' heart beat
rather thickly as he remembered his last visit to
this room: how Defasquelle had come in; how he,
Jack, had sat on the club fender, very conscious
during the scene which followed that Lyda Pavoya
must be hidden behind the curtains or the screen;
how he had advised Pat to do what Defasquelle
asked; how Pat refused, and showed the safe in the
wall which was already open.
</p>

<p>
"Here's his seal ring," Juliet was saying.  "I
found it lying on the desk.  This is what I brought
you in to see.  Now take the ring in your hand,
please.  Look at it closely, and tell me if you notice
anything odd."
</p>

<p>
As Jack took the ring, he recalled that Pat had
pulled it off his finger and given it to Defasquelle,
telling the Frenchman to compare it with the seals on the
packet.  Relieved that, for a moment, Juliet was
letting Lyda's name rest in peace, he examined the ring.
</p>

<p>
"I see nothing peculiar, unless a tiny bit of red
stuff stuck in the corner of the eye," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" cried Juliet, "I thought you'd see that!
What do you think the red stuff is?"
</p>

<p>
"Might be sealing-wax."
</p>

<p>
"That's just what it is.  I used a magnifying-glass
to make sure.  Which showed me something
else, too.  But I haven't quite come to that yet!
Pat never seals his letters with red wax.  He dislikes
red things: you know yourself he always uses
grey-blue wax.  He said it reminded him of my eyes!
You saw the packet Defasquelle brought from
France?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then you know it was sealed with five red seals.
I have the box and wrappings upstairs, if you don't
remember."
</p>

<p>
"I do remember."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  You can guess what I'm driving at?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I can."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Now for the other thing the magnifying-glass
told me.  But no—take it yourself.  There's
a scratch across the eye on the ring.  You see it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know who was supposed to have sealed
up the packet?"
</p>

<p>
"Mayen, of course: with a duplicate ring Pat had
made for him on purpose."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a duplicate.  But <i>would the scratch have
been copied</i>?  It shows on all five seals of the packet.
I looked through the magnifier."
</p>

<p>
"Juliet!  You accuse Pat——"
</p>

<p>
"Or Pavoya.  I said it must lie between him and
her."
</p>

<p>
Jack did not answer at once.  He saw the sinister
importance of this discovery which Juliet had made.
His mind rushed back to yesterday.  Lyda Pavoya
had been left alone in the study, for how long he did
not know.  But Pat had given her a chance to get
away.  He had made an excuse to show both men
something in the Chinese room next door.  Then,
when Defasquelle pleaded an engagement, Pat had
rung for Togo to guide the Frenchman out.  A little
later Jack also had gone.  What Pat had done after
that, who could tell?  His own man Nickson, perhaps,
or one of the other servants.  Jack pushed the
name of Lyda Pavoya violently out of his mind.  He
would not ask himself what she knew about Pat's
next movements and about the red seals.
</p>

<p>
When these thoughts had shot through his head,
bringing actual bodily pain, he drew a long breath,
and forced himself to speak.  Juliet was waiting!
"It's very necessary to have a detective to tackle this
business," he said.  "I realize that fact more than
ever now.  It's essential for Pat's own sake, if—for
no one else's.  A sharp chap may be able somehow
or other to pulverize this beastly theory you're
forming, Juliet.  He'll make tests for fingerprints
on the safe in the wall.  If there are others besides
Pat's, of course——"
</p>

<p>
"And Lyda Pavoya's!"
</p>

<p>
"It's not worthy of you to spring to such
conclusions!"  Manners broke out before he could control
himself.  He expected Juliet to retort furiously,
but she did not.  She merely looked piteous—and
young.
</p>

<p>
"Jack," she said, sadly, "what am I going to do if
that woman takes <i>you</i> away from me as well as Pat?"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," he bluffed.  "I hope I shall show
that she hasn't taken Pat—or anything of yours.
You don't <i>want</i> her proved guilty, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Not unless she is.  But I'd rather it would be
Pavoya than Pat.  And it seems as if it must be one
or the other."
</p>

<p>
"It seems so to <i>you</i>—now.  But wait."
</p>

<p>
Juliet looked at him anxiously.  "Can you think
of any one else to suspect?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't had much time to think yet," said
Jack.  "To-morrow morning early, I'll get the best
private detective in town: one who won't talk.
Meanwhile, we must be patient.  I suppose, of course,
you've questioned Nickson about his master?"
</p>

<p>
"That was one of the first things I did.  Poor old
Nick was almost bowled over when I said I feared
that something had happened to his adored one.
I didn't mention the pearls—naturally!—or that I
thought Pat might have disappeared of his own
accord.  I watched Nick's face to see what he <i>knew</i>.  I
don't think he has an idea where Pat has gone.
But—Jack, <i>he knows something</i>—something wild horses
wouldn't drag out of him.  I feel—I have a
<i>flair</i>—it's about Pavoya.  I've an idea Nick has taken
messages.  Togo has been bribed by her, too, I'm
sure.  And he won't speak.  The woman is like
Circe, with men of all sorts and classes.  She has
but to look at them to turn them into beasts!"
</p>

<p>
"The woman" had looked at Jack.  But she had
not turned him into a beast.  He had never felt less
like a beast in his life than he felt at this moment!
Yet—saint or Circe—by some magic she had won
his loyalty.  "Wild horses" would not have dragged
her secrets from Nickson, Juliet said, and Jack
believed she might be right.  As for him, he would have
had his tongue cut out sooner than tell his cousin
that he was engaged to sup at Lyda's house.  And
it was almost time to go!
</p>

<p>
What excuse could he make for leaving Juliet
abruptly, without hurting her?  He would not hurt
her for a great deal.  But he would hurt her if he
must, rather than be late!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br>
SUPPER AT TWELVE
</h3>

<p>
The house taken furnished by Lyda Pavoya belonged
to a woman well known in society, who had
gone abroad.  Jack Manners had visited there
before the war; but the drawing room was changed.
There had been banal things in it.  Now they were
gone.  Banality could not exist near Lyda.  It
seemed that in every form it must shrivel up, burnt
away by the still fire of her strange, secret soul.
</p>

<p>
Jack had pictured himself entering a room full
of people, fellow guests, and finding no one, he
feared that he had come too soon.  If stage stars
invited one for midnight, they probably meant one
to turn up at half-past twelve, so that, if they
sailed in at one o'clock, one would not be annoyed.
When the door opened five minutes after his arrival,
therefore, he expected to see some theatrical or
social "swell."  But it was Lyda who appeared—alone.
</p>

<p>
He had never met her off the stage until yesterday,
at the door of the Phayre house.  Then she had been
dressed in black, and thickly veiled.  He had guessed
her identity from the extreme grace and slimness
of her tall figure, and the flame of her red hair
glimpsed through embroidered net.  In Paris, where
she had danced, he had sat too far away to criticise
her features, and at the theatre to-night he'd been
dazzled by the wonder of her as a swan-woman.
</p>

<p>
Now, as she drifted in with the air of a tired,
overworked girl needing rest, and mutely asking for
help in securing it, Jack had the thrill of a new
revelation.  How many sides had this Polish dancer's
nature?  Was he to have a different sort of thrill
each time he met her, always more poignant, more
soul-piercing than before?
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to see you," she said.  "I thought I
should be here first.  I hope I've not kept you
waiting?"
</p>

<p>
"Not five minutes," Jack assured her.
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Will you take off my wrap for me?
When I heard you had come I wouldn't wait for my
maid."
</p>

<p>
She had unfastened the emerald clasps of a long,
oddly shaped cloak of purple velvet lined with
clouds of green chiffon over gold.
</p>

<p>
As Jack lifted it from her white shoulders, to his
surprise he heard himself exclaim, "I'd imagined
you in sables."  (What right had he to make a
"personal" comment like that?)
</p>

<p>
"So other people have told me," she said.  "But
I have one peculiarity: I never wear furs.  To me
it is horrible that women can cover themselves with
the skins of lovely creatures murdered for their
pleasure: pathetic little faces and feet and tails dangling
all over them!  No.  When I was a child I suffered
too much from the cruelty of the strong to the weak
to find joy in profiting from it."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" exclaimed Jack.  "I've thought sometimes
of that sort of thing.  But I didn't suppose
it ever occurred to women, even the tenderest ones
I've known."
</p>

<p>
"The women you have known haven't had childhoods
like mine," said Lyda.  "Yet I hoped you'd
not be one to make fun of my feeling.  Another
thing: I do not eat meat for the same reason.  You
will see, at supper.  But you shall have some, so
don't be discouraged!"
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, she smiled, and Jack realized that
it was the first time he had seen her smile.  That
was strange!  Or, it would have been strange in
another woman.  Now he saw that it would be more
strange, altogether out of keeping with this character
voluntarily opening itself to him, if she laughed or
smiled often.
</p>

<p>
Jack had obeyed a gesture of hers, and laid the
faintly perfumed cloak on a sofa.  Lyda wore a
dress simple enough for the first dinner-gown of a
schoolgirl: grey and short—almost "skimpy," yet
somehow perfect, without a single touch of trimming
or a jewel.  "Shall we go into the dining room?"
she asked.  "Supper will be ready.  It always is.
I never have it announced unless I've a party.
To-night it's only you and me.  You'll not mind?"
</p>

<p>
"Mind!"  The word spoke itself with a boyish
sincerity that Jack could not have pretended.  "I
didn't dare dream——"
</p>

<p>
She led the way through open sliding doors to an
adjoining room, not turning her head to listen as she
let Jack push the half-drawn portières aside.  What
a divine back she had, and what dimples in the
delicate, flat shoulder-blades!  An almost overpowering
desire gripped Jack to kiss the white neck just where
a knot of shining red hair was kept in place by a jade
pin.  He would no more have ventured upon a
liberty with this creature of unfathomed reserves
than he would have thrown himself into the cage
of a tigress.  All the same, he had definitely "lost
his head."  He knew that he would have sacrificed
Juliet and Pat for this girl, not deliberately, not
through conviction, but because he couldn't help
himself if it came to a choice!
</p>

<p>
In the octagon-shaped room where its late mistress
had given famous dinners for eight—never less,
never more—a small table was laid and lit with
shaded candles, but no servants were there.  Violets
were scattered on the lace table-cover, the only flower
decorations.  For the guest there were several
elaborate cold dishes and champagne in ice; for the
hostess, brown bread and a jug of milk!  When
she saw Jack look at this, Lyda laughed out aloud.
</p>

<p>
"I never take anything else at night," she
explained.  "I suppose I'm a queer person.
Probably you're thinking me odd in many ways: for one,
to have you alone with me at supper.  I've a
companion who lives with me, Madame Lemercier, a
nice woman.  But I do what I wish without thinking
of conventions, if I hurt no one.  People say so
many things about me, they can say no worse, whatever
I do!  That's partly why I act as I please.  Yet
I think I'd do the same without an excuse.  I
invited you because I want to talk with you alone;
no Madame Lemercier; no servants.  I'll wait on
you myself."
</p>

<p>
"Not that!" said Manners.  "You must let me
wait on you!"
</p>

<p>
"We'll wait on each other," she smiled.
</p>

<p>
A sense of exquisite intimacy with this girl, or
woman (he knew not what to call her) took possession
of Jack.  For a few minutes they ate, and he
talked of anything that flashed into his mind.  When
Lyda had finished her milk he jumped up, and filled
the glass again.  Then she said abruptly: "I recognized
you, at the theatre—from <i>yesterday</i>.  Did you
think I would?"
</p>

<p>
"No!"  Jack reddened to his sun-bleached hair.
</p>

<p>
"But—you must have known I was in Claremanagh's
study when—you were there."
</p>

<p>
"I—wasn't sure."
</p>

<p>
"Yet you thought so!  You're not a man who
can lie well.  And you are the cousin of Claremanagh's
wife.  You thought badly of me."
</p>

<p>
"I'd no right to think badly," Jack staved her
off.  "It wasn't my affair!"
</p>

<p>
"I asked you here to-night to <i>make</i> it your affair."
</p>

<p>
Jack had a shock of disappointment.  That
wonderful, heart-piercing first look of hers which he
had read, "You are <i>the</i> man: I am <i>the</i> woman!"
hadn't meant much after all.
</p>

<p>
"You see," Lyda went on, "I think that perhaps
you and I have known each other a long time: in
another life: perhaps in more lives than one.  Souls
that have been friends—or more than friends—group
together on earth many times, no doubt.  Did you
feel this when we met to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" Jack said, his breath choked.  "I know
it must have been that.  I knew even then it was the
most wonderful thing ever!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> felt it even yesterday, when I passed you at
Claremanagh's door," she told him.  "I thought:
'There's a man I may never see again, but we could
be friends, and we <i>have</i> been friends, though maybe
he has forgotten.'  When I was in the study behind
the curtains—Claremanagh put me there: he didn't
want me seen—I was sorry you should believe things
not true."
</p>

<p>
"I did not!" Jack protested.
</p>

<p>
"No?  Then—I am glad."
</p>

<p>
The man felt ashamed, remembering suddenly
what he <i>had</i> believed yesterday—even to-day.  Her
words, "I am glad," cut him to the quick, and he
hurried on along the way of atonement.  "You say
you asked me here to 'make it my affair'—about
Claremanagh.  Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know yet what is best.  We will talk it
over," she answered.  "But first you will have to
hear a story.  It's a long story: how I met
Claremanagh, and a great many things that came of the
meeting.  You won't be bored?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you need an answer to that question?"
</p>

<p>
Lyda gave him one of her rare smiles.  "No.  It
was conventional of me to ask.  But—it will not be
conventional to tell you the story.  It would
be—even <i>dangerous</i> to tell it to some men.  I'm not
afraid with you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for saying that!"
</p>

<p>
She held out her hand to him across the small
round table.  Jack seized it, and pressed it closely
instead of kissing the pink palm as he was tempted
to do.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Lyda sat still, her eyes cast down,
as if she sought for words which eluded her.  Then
she began in a low voice that was slightly monotonous,
as though she spoke out of an old dream.  She
paused sometimes; but Manners remained silent,
asking no questions.  He felt that she would prefer
this.
</p>

<p>
She took him back with her to Petrograd (St. Petersburg
then) when she was sixteen, ten years before.
She was dancing in a second-rate café, and attracted
attention, so that the place became popular.  A man
named Konrad Markoff was the real owner, though
he posed as an amateur patron.  By his advice, the
manager got Lyda to sign a hard and fast contract
to dance at the same salary for the next five years.
Markoff pretended a fatherly kindness for her; and
she was invited occasionally to visit his wife, a
Frenchwoman who had lived for years in England.
</p>

<p>
One night Markoff brought a good-looking English
boy of nineteen or so to the café.  This boy
applauded Lyda's dancing, and was introduced to her
at his own request: The Duke of Claremanagh.
From the first he was enthusiastic about her talent:
not in love ("oh, not at all in love!" Lyda insisted),
but anxious to "help a budding genius."  At the
end of a week he had thought out a practical plan.
He would pay for the dancing lessons of which she had
dreamed, as of an impossible Paradise: lessons from
the great Sophia Verasova.  It would cost a lot,
yes, but he'd just had a few unexpected thousands
left to him by an aunt.  If Lyda wouldn't accept,
they were sure to be spent on some foolery.  She
did accept.  Perhaps she might have accepted even
if Claremanagh hadn't made it quite clear how
impersonal, how disinterested were his motives!
</p>

<p>
Never—the dancer confessed—had she met a
"good man" in those days.  She would have made
an idol of this handsome boy; but he didn't want her
idolatry.  He was fancying himself in love with the
wife of a Don at Oxford just then!
</p>

<p>
To free her from slavery at the café, Claremanagh
paid a big indemnity; and at the time Lyda was
grateful to Markoff for arranging the business, not then
aware that he was the power behind the throne.
It was nearly two years later when the truth was
sprung upon the girl, just as she expected to go with
Verasova to make her début in Paris.  Markoff
had wished her to be educated and become a great
dancer without expense to himself.  There were
several ways in which she could be valuable, and
unless she promised her services to him, he would
prevent her from leaving Petrograd.
</p>

<p>
Claremanagh had been too carelessly trustful to
have the release from her contract framed in a
legal document, and Lyda could still be compelled
to carry it out.  Unless she agreed to use the charm
she had, the fame she might win, in the secret service
of Russia, she <i>would</i> be thus compelled!
</p>

<p>
Lyda was not old enough to understand the hideousness
of this bargain.  She wasn't yet eighteen; and
not to go with Verasova would have seemed worse
than death.  It was only later, when she had soared
to brilliant success, that she realized fully what she
was expected to do.  Engagements were offered to
her in the capitals of different countries: after Paris,
Rome, and then London.  She met many men of
distinction, sailors, soldiers, diplomats, financiers.
She was to flirt with these men—just how seriously,
was her own affair!—and get them inadvertently
to tell her things useful to the Tsar's government.
</p>

<p>
Well, she <i>had</i> flirted!  But she had sickened at the
business behind the flirtations.  Very little
information reached Russia through Lyda Pavoya!
Reproaches and threats came to her from Markoff;
and as a warning of what he could do to bring about
her ruin if he chose, Russians in England, France,
Italy, America, set the ball of scandal rolling against
her.  According to them she was a professional
siren, a mercenary blood-sucker, a "tigress woman,"
a devourer of men's happiness and honour!  Against
such a campaign a woman, placed as she was, found
herself helpless.  She could only shrug her shoulders,
go her own way, and try not to care!
</p>

<p>
But the war, like an ill wind that blows good to
some, changed the world for Lyda.  She worked
heart and soul in Paris for the Red Cross.  The
Russian Revolution broke like a red sunrise and with
the end of Tsardom she hoped that Markoff's power
over her would end also.  For some months she had
no word from him.  Then he appeared in Paris—at
a bad moment for her.
</p>

<p>
Claremanagh had been there on leave.  He had
come to her house, complaining that he felt ill.  At
luncheon he had fallen from his chair in a dead faint.
The doctor had pronounced the attack a virulent
case of influenza.  Claremanagh couldn't be moved.
Lyda, helped by Madame Lemercier, had nursed
him.  He thought she had saved his life—vowed
that he owed her more than she had ever owed
him.  There was endless gossip, of course, but Lyda
had been so glad to repay her debt of gratitude that
she hadn't much cared.
</p>

<p>
It was soon after Claremanagh had gone back
to the front, and while people were still coupling
their names in a scandalous way, that Konrad
Markoff arrived in Paris.
</p>

<p>
"At last the time has come when you can be of
real use to me," he had said.
</p>

<p>
Lyda had hoped that this was "bluff."  But
Markoff explained.  He explained things of which
she had never dreamed.
</p>

<p>
With brutal frankness he told the girl that he had
made Claremanagh's acquaintance in Petrograd for
a very special purpose.  He had married his French
wife because she had been maid to the young Duchess
of Claremanagh, and knew something about the
famous pearls.  Always he, and men associated with
him, had kept track of the family fortunes.  He
had known that the boy intended to visit the scene
of his ancestor's great romance.  Had it not been
for some treachery (he believed that his own wife
had sent anonymous warnings to the Claremanaghs)
the lost treasure would long ago have returned to
Russia.  Now, though his associates were dead or in
Bolshevik prisons, and the crown was a legend,
he—Markoff—wanted the pearls for himself.
</p>

<p>
Lyda had more than repaid Claremanagh's
generosity, all of which, Markoff argued, she owed
directly to <i>him</i>.  She was in a position to demand
any favour she liked of the Duke.  She must get
him to lend her the Tsarina pearls.  If she refused
to do this, she should be denounced as a spy.  Even
though her activities had been stopped by the revolution,
the war was still on!  Markoff had letters which
would convict her.  She—the adored one, the divine
dancer—would be tried and shot some morning at
dawn.
</p>

<p>
It would be nothing to die, Lyda had thought.
But she loved France.  She could not bear to die as a
traitor!  What to do then?  Suddenly a plan came
to her.  She agreed to ask Claremanagh for the
pearls.
</p>

<p>
"You see," she explained to Manners, "Markoff
had had a copy made, from an old portrait of the
Tsarina.  He meant me to hand him over the real
pearls, and give the false to Claremanagh.  But he
didn't know that Claremanagh's mother had had
them copied.  Hardly any one did know.  But
Claremanagh had told me.  And it was that copy I asked
him to lend!  He couldn't bear to refuse my very
first request.  Poor fellow, he hated to grant it,
though!  It was just after he'd fallen in love with
Miss Phayre—before they were engaged.  There
was enough talk about him and me, without my
wearing those well-known pearls.  It was part of
my bargain with Markoff to appear with them in
public, for he wanted my name to be coupled with
Claremanagh's.  It would give me more power over
his future.  And even if the Duke told people that he
was lending me a copy, they wouldn't believe it.
They would have laughed at the idea of Pavoya
accepting false pearls.
</p>

<p>
"Claremanagh sent to London for the things.
My wearing them made a sensation!  Markoff
was wild with rage when he saw what they were—wild
against Claremanagh, not me.  He believed
that I'd been tricked.  Of course the copy was of no
use to him.  He did not take it.  But he would not
let me give it back to the Duke.  He was working
up a scheme of blackmail against us both.  I dared
not disobey—and once the mischief was done by my
wearing the rope Claremanagh didn't much mind
whether I kept it or not.  I pretended to forget,
and he didn't mention the subject.  Then I got this
surprise offer to dance in New York.  I was <i>so</i> glad!
I thought I might get rid of Markoff.  How foolish!
He sailed in the ship with the Duke and Duchess,
but kept out of their way.  Claremanagh never
knew he was on board—and perhaps wouldn't have
remembered him from those old Petrograd days if
he had seen his face.
</p>

<p>
"Now, we come to these last few weeks in New
York," Lyda finished.  "Do you begin to see
Markoff's game?"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite," Jack answered.  It was the first time
he had spoken since she began her story.  "It isn't
clear to me yet—at least where Pat Claremanagh's
concerned."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't to me at first.  But Markoff made it
clear.  He didn't try direct blackmail against the
Duke.  He was afraid, I think, that Claremanagh
would fight—even though he'd hate scandal for his
wife's sake.  I was the catspaw.  Markoff really
did have letters which I had sent him in those hateful
days when I had to content him with a pretense of
spying.  There were always those to hold over my
head.  And he threatened to order the wearing of
those wretched false pearls again as an open insult
to the Duchess.  He thought that, for answer, she
would wear the real ones!  Then he would be sure
they were in New York, and he might have the
chance at last which he'd been trying for all these
years: the chance to steal them."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, you are unravelling the whole mystery!"
Jack broke out.  But Lyda shook her head.  "No!
I'm afraid you'll not think that when you've heard
what's to come," she said.  "I'm afraid I shall make
the mystery even deeper.  I was faced with shame
for myself and the ruin of Claremanagh's
happiness—through my fault—my seeming selfishness.  The
alternative was money—oh, but a great sum of
money—enough to console Markoff for giving up
his hope of the pearls.  Never till then had I told
Claremanagh of Markoff's tyranny.  But for his
own sake and mine I had to explain something.  We
consulted—about what was best to be done.
Claremanagh wished to do what he called 'wave the red
flag.'  But I made him realize what his wife's feelings
would be if he were mixed up in such a case at
law, with me.  At last we agreed that it would be
wise to pay Markoff and be free of him.  I earn a
great deal of money, and—spend it.  It took some
time to get the sum together.  I sold nearly all my
jewels, and what I didn't sell, I pawned.  Still
there wasn't enough, and Claremanagh came to the
rescue.  He said it was for <i>himself</i>—but of course
it was far more for me!  It was only when the money
was every <i>sou</i> in hand that I dared give back the
imitation pearls.  I went to do that when you met
me at the door: to do that and to hand Claremanagh
two thirds of the hush-money for Markoff.  The
rest he had ready in his safe.  He offered—he
wanted—to meet the man and exchange the money for the
letters.  Now, Captain Manners, you know the
whole history of the 'Pavoya'-Claremanagh affair.
But perhaps you don't yet understand all the reasons
why I've told it, two hours after we were introduced
to each other—you and I!"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes challenged him.  Jack saw that she
wished him to understand, and so he did not mean
to make a mistake.  He thought before he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder?" he said.  "I could be more sure
where I am if I knew whether you're in the secret
of Pat's doings to-night."
</p>

<p>
Lyda looked puzzled and pale.  "His doings—to-night?
No, last night he saw Markoff and got
back the letters.  But to-night's doings—no.  I am
not in the secret—if there is a secret."
</p>

<p>
Jack caught at her words.  He was intensely
excited by what she had told him, but he kept his
outward coolness.  Lyda had gone through a great
strain.  He did not care to alarm her needlessly.
</p>

<p>
"You say Pat saw Markoff, and got the letters.
You're sure of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he sent me the letters with a short note,
just after receiving them, saying 'all was right.'"
</p>

<p>
"Did the note come from home?"
</p>

<p>
"No, from a club: the 'Grumblers'.  It was
written rather late."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't Pat say anything about himself—where
he was going from the club, what had happened
since you met, or what he meant to do to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing—except that he was writing in a hurry
after 'settling up with Markoff' and seeing the last
of him, for he had 'something rather important to
do.'  That was all, absolutely all.  Captain Manners, you
look strange!  What have you to tell me in exchange
for my story?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, to begin with, that I don't understand as
I thought I did, why you've told it," Jack stammered.
"I imagined it was because you knew Pat and my
cousin had quarrelled, that he had left her—or
anyhow disappeared—and you wanted me to justify
you with Juliet."
</p>

<p>
Lyda stared at him across the table, her hands
suddenly pressed over her heart.  "<i>Mon Dieu!</i>"
she whispered.  "Claremanagh disappeared!"
</p>

<p>
"But," went on Jack, collecting his wits, "if you
didn't know, what did you mean when you said that
Markoff's hand in the pearl business didn't clear up
the mystery, but only made it more mysterious?"
</p>

<p>
"I meant, of course, those innuendos in that horrible
paper—the hints that the Duchess was wearing
false pearls.  It is not to Markoff's advantage to
start such a rumour now.  He has nothing to gain—no
longer any hold over Claremanagh or me.  He
would do himself no good, but much harm.  Oh,
Captain Manners, where can the Duke be?"
</p>

<p>
"I came here to-night racking my brains vainly
as to that," Jack encouraged her.  "Now, thanks
to you, I've something to go upon, something to tell
the detective whom I shall see first thing to-morrow.
This Markoff is my starting point now: his scheme of
years to steal the pearls.  How he can have got into
the house, opened the safe, taken the things out of
the box, and sealed it up again with the false pearls
inside, I can't see yet, but——"
</p>

<p>
Lyda sprang to her feet.  "You say—he has done
<i>that</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Someone has done that.  You—Pat didn't tell
you in his letter, about what had happened to the
box you must have seen?"
</p>

<p>
"No—no.  He didn't mention the pearls—or the
box.  Who discovered the theft?"
</p>

<p>
"Juliet.  Pat gave her the sealed packet, and—she's
rather an expert!—she found the pearls were
false."
</p>

<p>
"Yet—she wore them."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then that was because she thought I——"
</p>

<p>
"Don't say it!"
</p>

<p>
"Can <i>you</i> say it wasn't her thought?"
</p>

<p>
"She's accused her own husband—whom she adores."
</p>

<p>
"Or me!  Was that not it?"
</p>

<p>
Jack was silent.
</p>

<p>
With a little cry Lyda covered her face with her
hands, and he saw that she trembled.  Hardly
knowing what he did he went to her, took the two cold
hands and held them to his lips.  She looked up to
him with eyes bright with tears, and—the next
instant she was in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"We'll work together," he said, "you and I.
We'll drag this mystery up by the roots.  We'll
find Pat, wherever he is, and Juliet shall beg your
pardon on her knees."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br>
THE FORTUNE TELLER
</h3>

<p>
Manners did not go to his hotel when he left
Lyda.  He walked for miles.  He was happy.  He
was proud.  He was wretched.  He was ashamed.
He believed in Lyda Pavoya.  He doubted her.
There would not have been room for the volcano
of his feelings between four walls.
</p>

<p>
That moment when he had held her in his arms had
been the most wonderful if not the greatest in his life.
But it had been only a moment.  Her surrender for
a few seconds had seemed to him then the most
exquisite thing in the world: the childlike longing
for a man's chivalrous protection, in the heart of a
woman who had known little chivalry!  In an
instant she had drawn herself gently away, and he
had not held her.  He had wished Lyda to know
that, if he did not understand everything, at least
he understood why she had crept into his arms for
that brief breathing space, and that he would take
no advantage of her yielding.
</p>

<p>
He had armoured himself with an almost exaggerated
friendliness afterward; and for a while they
had talked not at all of themselves, but of Juliet
and Pat.  They tried to form some theory which
might account for the disappearance of the pearls
from the locked safe whose combination was known
to only two persons; the replacing of the parcel
there, sealed with fresh seals.  They had striven to
implicate Markoff in the affair, but all their
deductions stumbled against the same blank wall in the
end.  It seemed impossible that Markoff could even
have entered the house, much less have got into
the study or opened the safe.  Lyda did not know
how Pat had obtained the money to help her out with
the payment to Markoff.  It had not seemed strange
to her that he should have it.  Looking back, it
seemed strange now.  Yet it was incredible that
he should have juggled with the packet, and risked
losing his wife's respect by palming off false pearls
on her, in order to get money for another woman.
</p>

<p>
Incredible!  And yet, Lyda said, like one in a
dream, that he was the only person who could have
done the thing—<i>except herself</i>!
</p>

<p>
"I know <i>I</i> didn't do it, and—yes, I know he didn't
do it!" she cried to Jack.  So, again and again they
came through darkness to that blank wall!  And
at last, deadly tired in body and brain, Lyda sent
Manners away.
</p>

<p>
He was all exaltation at first.  The glamour and
perfume of her ran through his veins.  She was noble,
magnificent.  It was great of this glowing creature
to trust him so generously, to tell him her life story,
putting herself in his power in a way, for the sake
of Claremanagh's happiness.  It was fine of her to
say he might repeat all to Juliet, who—Lyda must
know—detested and distrusted her with the obstinacy
of a spoiled, jealous child: to say that, if necessary,
a detective might be trusted with her secrets.
</p>

<p>
But as the chill of the night iced his veins, Jack's
mood changed.  Juliet's point of view suddenly
showed itself sharply to his eyes.  It was as if she
had come from round the corner of the last street
he had passed, to walk with him.  <i>Had</i> Lyda told
him the story for Claremanagh's sake and Juliet's?
<i>Why not for her own</i>—in the daring wish to make a
"friend at court?"  Would that not be more like
her—more like the woman she was supposed to be?
</p>

<p>
She knew that he had seen her go into the Phayre
house; that he must have guessed she was hidden
in the study; that he was Juliet's cousin and would
naturally be inclined to work for Juliet's interest.
Would it not be a bold and clever stroke to win him to
her side?
</p>

<p>
If it were some other man, not himself, whose
prejudices had been thus broken down in an hour
by a woman's eyes and voice, wouldn't he pity the
poor idiot who believed that he alone fathomed the
depths of her smile?
</p>

<p>
Lyda practically admitted that she had fooled
many men.  Some of them had doubtless known far
more about women than he knew.  Why, she must
have been laughing at him all through!  He had been
a child in her hands!
</p>

<p>
Lies that were half truths could be welded into a
fabric hard to break down.  No doubt there were
true details in that life history of Pavoya.  But
how many true ones?  And was it "fine" of her to
"consent" that he should tell Juliet, and if necessary
a detective?  Wasn't that just what she'd worked
up to, and wanted?  Wasn't she purposely turning
suspicion toward Pat when she said, as if dazed,
that only he or she could have changed the pearls?
</p>

<p>
Jack heard himself again, warmly promising that
they two should work together, that they'd drag up
the mystery by the roots, and that Juliet should beg
her pardon.
</p>

<p>
A spider's dainty web of opal-gauze, glittering with
dew, must look a fairy palace to a big, blundering
bluebottle!
</p>

<p>
Did such a man as Markoff from Petrograd even <i>exist</i>?
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Dawn flowed like a pale river through the canyons
of the New York streets when Manners' walk ended
at his own hotel.
</p>

<p>
He felt as if he had been through a battle—a battle
that he hadn't won.  But a cold splash, and then
dead sleep for an hour, braced him physically.  He
woke with a start, as if somebody had knocked; yet
no one was at the door.  The thought of food
disgusted him; hot, strong black coffee, however, was
refreshing.
</p>

<p>
It was early still, yet he was sure that Juliet would
be awake, and called her up, learning at once that
she had no news.  Yes, he <i>had</i> things to tell, he
answered her eager question.  "Not news exactly,
but important."  Before going to her, however, he
intended to see the detective they'd talked about:
a man named Henry Sanders—used to be in the
police—sharp chap; had the nickname of "Hawkeye
Harry"; retired, but got bored with doing nothing,
and started as a private detective; had made a big
success in the last few years; absolutely to be trusted:
silent as the grave and sharp as a razor.
</p>

<p>
Jack added that he knew the man personally, and
as he didn't wish to wait for office hours, would ring
Sanders up at his own house.  He would call there
and tell the man something of the case to save Juliet
useless questions and answers.  Then, he hoped, they
could both come round to see her.
</p>

<p>
As it turned out, however, Manners went alone to
the Phayre house.  He had not seen Sanders.  The
detective (to whom Jack had vainly tried to 'phone
the night before) had not yet returned from the
country where he had spent the last few days.  He
had luckily left word that he would be at his office
by ten o'clock; and having sent a request for an
immediate appointment there, Jack was ready for a
talk with his cousin.
</p>

<p>
It was hard to put Lyda Pavoya's case impersonally
and impartially to Juliet.  As he framed the
story in his own words, he saw Lyda again as he had
seen her last night, heard her sweet, vibrating voice
with its delicious accent.  The glamour of the
woman took possession of him once more.  He tried
to be judicial, but he could be so only in manner.
Telling the tale, he was impressed with the way
detail after detail fitted itself into probability; and
as Juliet's face showed how the door of her mind
shut against Lyda, his own opened.  He had left
Lyda, and had become her judge.  Juliet's silent
antagonism made him again Lyda Pavoya's defender.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe one word!" Juliet flamed out,
when he had finished.
</p>

<p>
Manners found himself quite unreasonably angry:
he, who had walked the streets raging against his
own weakness for Pavoya!
</p>

<p>
"You wanted me to get her story," he said.  "Well,
I've <i>got</i> it, and all you have to say is that it's a pack
of lies.  I can do no more."
</p>

<p>
Juliet felt stricken.  "Do you mean you take it
all as gospel truth yourself?" she challenged.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me to hang together perfectly."
</p>

<p>
"It <i>would</i>!  She's clever as—a serpent."
</p>

<p>
Jack frowned.  "You don't seem pleased to have
your own husband turned into a hero instead of a
villain."
</p>

<p>
Colour flew to Juliet's pale cheeks.  "I don't
need Lyda Pavoya to do that for me!"
</p>

<p>
"Then," said Manners, coolly, "you make this
distinction.  You believe the good part about Pat,
and not the good part about her."
</p>

<p>
Juliet broke into tears.  "Oh, Jack," she reproached
him.  "I might have known!  You've gone over
absolutely to the enemy!"
</p>

<p>
Jack was conscience-stricken, for in a way it was
true.  He tried to console the girl as he had consoled
her yesterday, and in the old days when she was a
child.  There was no "enemy," he said, or at all
events the enemy wasn't Mademoiselle Pavoya.
It was essential that they should at least seem to
work in harmony.  Juliet must trust him.  She
must pull herself together, and be ready soon to see
the detective.
</p>

<p>
The Duchess was quieter when he had argued for
a while, and patted her shoulder, and called her
"darling child."  She dried her tears, and promised
to "be good"—but when Jack had gone to keep
his appointment at Sanders' office, her heart was
lead.  "He's Pavoya's man now!" she said to herself.
</p>

<p>
Having Lyda's permission to speak, and knowing
Sanders to be trustworthy, Manners kept nothing
back.  He began with a brief outline of the history
of the pearls, and Pat's business transaction with
Mayen.  This brought him to the arrival of the
messenger with the packet, and its delivery in his own
presence.  There, for the first time, Sanders stopped
him and asked questions: what had been Defasquelle's
manner, what the Duke's?  And Jack believed
that his answers impressed the detective
favourably toward the Frenchman.  It proved
the messenger's bona fides that he had insisted upon
the opening of the box in his presence.  Besides,
after the theft, it appeared certain that the new
seals had been made with the Duke's ring; and before
that could have happened, Manners had seen
Defasquelle leave the house.
</p>

<p>
Sanders would, of course, wish to meet Defasquelle,
but would prefer to talk with the Duchess first of
all.  Whether Mademoiselle Pavoya's version of her
visit to the Phayre house and her acquaintance with
the Duke were true, remained to be seen.  Sanders
had never heard of Markoff, but would take immediate
steps through the aid of his "best boys" to find
out all about the man—<i>if</i> he existed!  As for the
Duke, the detective didn't mind admitting to Jack
as a friend—not in an official capacity—that he didn't
yet believe there had been foul play.  He wasn't
sure that, in Claremanagh's place (assuming his
injured innocence) <i>he</i> wouldn't have gone away to
punish his wife.
</p>

<p>
"These spoiled heiresses are the limit when they get
going!" he said.  "And this Duke chap's Irish.
I'm Irish myself.  We fellows can't sit still when
even the prettiest woman forgets the Marquis of
Queensberry's rules in a scrap!  It gets our goat!"
</p>

<p>
Jack was not sure whether Juliet would prefer
an outside opinion that Pat had been kidnapped,
or had left her of his own free will.  But the girl's
pale beauty bowled Sanders over at first sight.  His
prejudice against the "spoiled heiress" melted like
ice in morning sunlight, and his Irish heart—as well
as his trained discretion—kept back any word which
he thought might wound her.  The assumption
(meant to be comforting) that with Markoff lay the
clue to the mystery, was, however, salt on an unhealed
scar for Juliet.  She took it instantly for granted
that Sanders agreed with Jack in believing Lyda
Pavoya had told the truth.
</p>

<p>
"They're going the wrong way to work!" she
thought, bitterly, when the two men had gone,
promising a report the moment there should be news of
any sort.  "The wrong way! ... If they find
out where Pat is, it will be just blundering—by
accident!"
</p>

<p>
In thwarted wretchedness, the girl realized that
it would be worse than useless to make such protests
to Sanders.  <i>He</i> was the detective, not she—though
he had complimented her upon her "smartness"
in the matter of the ring and the magnifying-glass.
He would only pity and despise her for jealousy and
prejudice if she gave him the advice she burned to give.
And Jack—Jack was <i>hopeless</i>!  He was lost to her.
</p>

<p>
She felt as miserably alone as if Jack had not
promised to be her "knight," and as if he had not brought
to her one of the best private detectives in the land.
She longed to strike out on her own account, to be
first in the field, and be able to say to these men:
"See, while you were wandering all round Robin
Hood's barn, <i>I've</i> found the place where the secret
was buried, and dug it up!"
</p>

<p>
It was mostly about Pat that Juliet thought, and
his disappearance.  Upon the pearls she wasted little
anxiety, though she hated to think that Pavoya
should have them.  She had cried out to Pat that
she believed not one word of the dancer's story:
and she had meant it at the time; but brooding alone
over the history of Pavoya's years, and the link
between her and Pat, Juliet found herself almost
arbitrarily accepting certain details here and there.
Yes, that must have been the way those two first
met!  Pat had told her that he had heard the call
of romance in Russia—his great-great-grandfather's
romance—and had left Oxford to spend the long
vacation among those scenes.  How like Pat at
nineteen to create a romance of his own on the same
spot!
</p>

<p>
Her heart yearned to Pat with the thought that
he had helped Pavoya because of <i>charity</i>, not love.
In that case he had told the truth—or as much truth
as his wife could expect of a man where women
were concerned.  But certainly, Juliet assured
herself, Pavoya had loved Pat and moved heaven and
earth to compromise him.  That was really why
she'd asked him to lend her the pearls.  No doubt
she'd begged for the real ones, and he'd lent her the
copy.  She'd kept the wretched beads, not because
of some melodramatic blackmail "stunt," but
because she wished to wear them as if they were real,
and get herself talked about with Pat.  Then, he'd
married, and having sent to France for the true
pearls for his wife, he couldn't leave the false ones
knocking about for Pavoya to play with.  He'd
practically ordered the woman to return them; and
in revenge, when an amazing chance came her way,
Pavoya had somehow stolen the genuine rope,
changing the contents of the packet!
</p>

<p>
It all seemed clearer and clearer to Juliet, and she
wondered that a man with such good brains as Jack's
could be so easily deceived.  In pride of her own
superior talent as a detective, the girl would have had
moments of triumphant joy had it not been for her
wearing anxiety about Pat.
</p>

<p>
Days passed.  Pat did not return or write to
Juliet or the bank.  And no news of importance
was obtained for her by Sanders or Jack.  Markoff
the detective was unable to trace by name, though
he had got upon the track of a Russian who had
lately arrived in New York with some good introductions.
His description answered that given of Konrad
Markoff by Mademoiselle Pavoya.  Boris Halbin
(who had figured at various New York clubs, and
was now supposed to have sailed for France) was a
person of inconspicuous appearance.  So, too, was
Markoff.  Many Russians over forty are "darkish,
stoutish, big faced, blunt featured, with beards
turning grey!"
</p>

<p>
Juliet bravely kept up the fiction with her friends
that she and Pat were on the best of terms.  He
was away on business for the bank.  He would soon
return.  That story about the pearls being false was
too silly for words!  The reason she'd stopped
wearing them was because she had broken the string, and
didn't want the responsibility of choosing the
person to mend it till Pat came back.  The girl would
have given thousands of dollars for the privilege
of "sporting her oak," and refusing to see the many
people whose devotion she attributed to curiosity.
But for the sake of the future, and her own pride's
sake, she would not do that.  She went out a good
deal, kept all her engagements, and made new ones.
Her nerves, however, revenged themselves upon her
mercilessly.  Once she had hardly realized that she
possessed such things as nerves.  Now they made
themselves felt each moment of the day, and through
hours of the long, restless nights.
</p>

<p>
Against his will, Sanders had consented to an
advertisement appearing in the "personal" column
of several papers.  Juliet had pleaded that no one
would know for whom it was meant, and—she
should die if she couldn't put it in!  Consequently,
curious eyes in many cities of the United States were
reading every day this appeal:—"Play Boy: 'American
Beauty' believes in you and wants you.  Write
or come back if you would not break her heart."
</p>

<p>
Who could guess that the Duchess of Claremanagh's
pet name for the Duke was "Play Boy," and
that he had sent her "American Beauty" roses every
day since they were engaged, because it was the name
he had found sweetest, most appropriate for her?
</p>

<p>
Yet, someone must have guessed: because in the
<i>Inner Circle</i> (a week after the sensational pearl
"Whisper") the secret was given away.  No names
were mentioned: yet none who knew the Claremanaghs
could have avoided reading between the lines.
</p>

<p>
It was while Juliet sat with the paper in her hands,
shamed, bewildered, almost stunned, that a sealed
envelope was brought on a tray to her boudoir.
Mechanically she opened it.  Within was a visiting
card, with something written upon it in pencil.
</p>

<p>
For an instant the girl's bruised brain could not
find the Comtesse de Saintville in the index of her
memory.  Then, suddenly, she saw the woman,
playing opposite her at some bridge table.  Yes,
of course, Lyda Pavoya's friend.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive my calling uninvited.  I hope you can
see me.  I have something to say which may be
important to you," the woman, whom Juliet vaguely
disliked, had scribbled in French under her name.
</p>

<p>
Juliet thought for a minute, with the card in her
hand.  It seemed "pushing" of this person to come,
and probably if she—Juliet—consented to see her,
she would regret the weakness.  Still, the one really
important thing on earth was news of Pat.  Madame
de Saintville <i>might</i> know something!  She might
have quarrelled with Pavoya, and be ready to "give
her away."  "Bring the lady up here," the Duchess
instructed Huji.
</p>

<p>
Presently the visitor was shown in; and Juliet,
rising to receive her, towered like a tall young goddess
over a small, smart creature, painted to look as
pretty as she thought she ought to be.
</p>

<p>
"She'll begin to speak of Pavoya," Juliet thought.
But she was mistaken.
</p>

<p>
"I have come on a very queer errand," were the
Countess's first words, spoken with much throaty
rolling of "rs".  "Perhaps you will be angry.  I made
up my mind only to-day that it was my duty to call."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes darted to the <i>Inner Circle</i> which Juliet
had just thrown aside, and quickly returned to a
flower with which she herself was playing.  But
Juliet read that side-glance to mean—"After
reading that paper to-day, I decided."
</p>

<p>
"When people tell one it's a duty to say or do
something in particular, it's generally disagreeable,"
Juliet said, drily.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, this is an exception!  It is not disagreeable
at all—I hope.  It is only—unusual," replied the
Comtesse de Saintville.  "But I will not keep you
in suspense.  Have you ever heard of a palmist
and fortune teller named Madame Veno?"
</p>

<p>
"Possibly.  I'm not sure," answered Juliet, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"She is not—or rather she has not been—fashionable,
I think," explained the other.  "I have not
lived long enough in New York to know these things.
I happened to hear of her through a friend of mine
(yours also, is it not?)—Mrs. Billee Lowndes.  It
was there I met you once.  Mrs. Lowndes knew I
was interested in the psychic things: crystal gazing,
palmistry.  She spoke of Madame Veno, who is
supposed to be only a manicurist.  Her real profession
is a secret.  It has to be!  It seems that 'Madame
Veno' is a name several women have used, like—one
would say, a '<i>trade</i> name,' because they have hired
the same rooms, or offices, and 'Madame Veno,
Manicurist' is on a doorplate.  That is odd, is it not?
But the first Madame Veno died—or something.
The present one is—ah, Duchess, she is <i>merveilleuse</i>.
She has told me things about myself—but things
only <i>le bon Dieu ou le diable</i> had in their knowledge!
Naturally, I have been to her more than once.  Last
time she looked through her crystal.  I do not know
if that is forbidden by your law?  <i>En tout cas</i>, she
does it.  The picture she saw must have been strange.
It seemed to frighten her.  When I asked some
questions, she said the vision was not for me.  It was for
another.  Why it came, she could not tell unless
that person was in my thoughts.  Then, Duchess,
she spoke your name.  <i>The picture was for you</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Really!" exclaimed Juliet.  She pretended to be
amused; but the woman's tone was meant to impress,
and did impress, the girl in spite of herself.  "What
did the picture represent?"
</p>

<p>
"Madame Veno did not mention, except that it
concerned the Duke.  She felt it would be wrong to
speak if not to you alone.  She wished me to give
you a message: to say, if you would come to her
place, she would look again in the crystal, and tell
you what she saw.  I did not like to call on you.
I am not long enough of your acquaintance.  But to-day——"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid to speak out what's in your
thoughts," Juliet said with a painful smile.  "You
have read the <i>Inner Circle</i>.  You think the disgusting
'Whisperer' is right!  That the advertisement which
people have been talking about is <i>mine</i>.  Of course
that's all nonsense!  Please tell everybody you meet,
who's interested in my affairs!  But probably you
meant to be kind.  Anyhow, I think fortune tellers
are great fun!  I shall go to this one—some day soon:
when I have time.  You'll give me the address?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Par coincidence</i>, Madame Veno is in the same
building with that <i>journal des blagues</i>," replied the
Countess.  "It goes without saying that they have
no connection, one with the other.  It is a mere
accident.  Mrs. Lowndes has told me that the first
woman of that trade name, 'Madame Veno,' was
really a manicurist: so it was necessary to have an
office, and not be in a private house in some quiet
street."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Juliet.  "I must thank you for
coming.  As Madame knows my name, she must know
a good deal about me, so her 'pictures' won't be as
exciting as if I went to her a stranger.  But they
may be amusing."
</p>

<p>
Her tone, though perfectly courteous, was meant
to end the interview.  Madame de Saintville rose.
Juliet did the same, and rang.  The moment she
was alone, she ran to her bedroom and commanded
Simone, who was there, to give her a hat and coat.
</p>

<p>
She had said she would go "some day" to Madame
Veno.  But she was going now—at once—at once!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br>
THE GREY ROOM
</h3>

<p>
Pat Claremanagh floated in a grey sea, under a
grey sky.  It seemed to him that the grey sea and
sky were part of some existence after death.  He
vaguely remembered that he had died.  If it were
not for the constant, heavy pain in his head, he
thought that he could recall the whole incident.
</p>

<p>
Yes, that was the word—"incident".  It hardly
mattered now, and wasn't worth while racking his
brain over.  That tin hat of his was too tight—much
too tight.  But he was too weak to lift his hands and
take it off.  Strange, though, that he should be
wearing it when he was dead!
</p>

<p>
He must have been killed in the war.  Yet, how
long ago the war seemed!  He had thought that a
great many things had happened to him after the
war.  No doubt they were part of this dream—this
long, floating dream—after death.  But they were
not grey like the leaden sea and the sky that hung
so low over his head.  They were beautiful, colourful
things.  Just straining to remember brought rainbow
flashes across his brain.  Out of these lights a girl's
face looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"Juliet!" he heard himself mutter, in a thick,
tongue-tied voice.
</p>

<p>
Instantly another face appeared, and blotted out
that of the girl.  This one was solid and very real.
It bent over him in the greyness: a man's face,
somehow familiar, as if he had known it long ago—long
ago disliked it: a fleshy bulk surrounded with
hair.  He loathed it for itself, and hated it for
shutting out the vision of Juliet, so he closed his eyes.
</p>

<p>
For a moment consciousness died down like a
fading flame.  Only a vast, vague greyness was left,
and the tight pain of the tin hat.  But when a few
moments or a few years had passed, a voice spoke.
It beat upon his dulled intelligence like the strokes
of a clock in the dark, telling an hour.  Pat was
suddenly keyed up to listening, because it was a
woman's voice, and far down within himself he was
aware that a woman's voice—a certain woman's
voice—was what he yearned to hear.
</p>

<p>
Strange!  He was wide awake, and knowledge
came to him that he was not dead, after all, though
he might be close to death.  But he did not open
his eyes, because he could not bear to see the living
mass of flesh and hair again.  He lay quite still.
And he listened.
</p>

<p>
"You are always hanging over him like that
whenever I turn my back!" said the woman.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  I do no harm," answered a man's
voice, with a rather soft, monotonous foreign accent.
</p>

<p>
Pat knew that the voice belonged to the face.  It
also had association with long past things which were
somehow important.  A scene began forming in his
tired mind, like bits of an old picture being matched
together.  A room with tables, and men drinking
and smoking; a cleared space; a kind of stage; a girl
dancing—slim, lovely, light as a fawn; long red hair
waving back and forth—Lyda!—that was her name.
Lyda—something.  He was at one of the tables,
very young, only a boy.  And the hairy man sat with
him, talking, praising the girl.  Markoff!
</p>

<p>
He stopped, remembering, and listened again.
</p>

<p>
"You'd do harm if you dared to," the woman said.
"You'd like to kill him."
</p>

<p>
"I tink it will be better for us all if he die," said
the man.  "Much better!  Much safer.  But no
violence.  Let him go—fade away.  I tought it
would soon be finished wiz him.  Zen he open his
eyes and look at me.  You hear him speak—some
word."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I heard him," the woman answered.  "It's
the first time he's made a sound—<i>since</i>, except a sort
of groaning.  I'm jolly glad.  <i>We</i> don't want him
to drop off the hooks.  Not <i>much</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"You are ver' foolish, Madam.  He can give your
'usband and ze ozzers away.  It is only me who
'ave nozzing to fear.  He do not see me zere.  Yet
I am witness agains' any ones who treat me wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh!" said the woman.  "You're always harping
on your power to hurt us.  It's nil.  The hunt's
out for you, Mr. Markoff or Halbin, or whatever
you like to be.  If we're keeping you for our own
sakes because you haven't paid up, anyhow it's your
game to lie low.  You daren't show your nose outside
this door.  But for heaven's sake, let's stop
arguing.  I'm for nothing in that part of the business."
</p>

<p>
"You 'ave all got some plan you try to work behin'
my back," growled the man.  "I tell you enough
times, ze money will come!"
</p>

<p>
"When it comes, you'll get the pearls: if it comes in
time.  That's the rub!"
</p>

<p>
The word "pearls" was like a key.  It unlocked
the door of Pat's memory, and impressions flowed in.
But they were confused, without beginning or end;
and he lay motionless, hoping for more clues.  He
was conscious that the woman leaned over him.
She brought with her a heavy oriental perfume, and
he felt a waft of warm breath on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Are you awake?" she asked, speaking slowly.
"Do you know what happened to hurt you—eh?"
</p>

<p>
Pat did not show by the quiver of an eyelid that
he had heard.
</p>

<p>
"Wen 'e come back to himself, bineby, 'e will
remember everything per'aps, an' zen w'ere will you
all be?" the man wanted to know.
</p>

<p>
"He never will remember, unless there's someone
to give him the tip.  People <i>don't</i> remember with
concussion," the woman said.
</p>

<p>
So that was what he had—<i>concussion</i> of the brain!
Pat wondered how he had got it.  One of the
impressions filtering back was of hitting a man, and
hearing him squeal.  What had followed was a blank,
like everything since.  Maybe some other man had
hit him—from behind.
</p>

<p>
The woman moved away, and cautiously Pat
opened his eyes.  The greyness was still there, but
it was more definite, more commonplace, as if belonging
to earth and things of everyday life.  He thought
that he must be lying on his back in a bed, looking
straight up at a low grey ceiling.  There were grey
walls, too, but he could not turn his head to see more,
as his neck was stiff and painful.  The light was so
dim that he imagined it must be drawing toward
dusk in a room with small windows partly covered
with curtains.
</p>

<p>
More talking went on at a distance, between the
man and woman.  Sometimes it sounded so far off
that Pat wondered if there was an adjoining room
with an open door.  Presently, when all had been
silent for so long that he had almost dozed off, there
was a sudden explosion of voices.  The listener
fancied that there were two new ones, both voices
of men, and one he recognized, though irritatingly
he could not attach the right name label.
</p>

<p>
He kept his eyes closed, because he was sure that
the latecomers would look at him, and his caution
was rewarded.  Someone turned on a light.  The
two new voices mumbled in sick-bed whispers across
his pillow.  He caught a word here and there: again
"the pearls," "Markoff," and "the Duchess."  The
last gave him an odd thrill.  <i>Juliet</i>!  She had
been angry.  How was she feeling now?  Was she
seeking for him?  Or did she give him credit for
running off with the pearls—or Lyda? or—both
together?
</p>

<p>
The thought that this might be so—probably was
so—made him long to spring up and fight his way to
his wife, somehow.  And perhaps he could not have
resisted attempting to move had not a sudden noise
snapped the thread of his thought.
</p>

<p>
A quarrel had broken out over something between
the men.  All three voices rose sharply.  The
woman intervened, and was rebuked.  Then came
a squall of rage, instantly stifled.  The woman
screamed, and drew in her breath with a gasp.  All
was still again.
</p>

<p>
"Hark!" whispered someone.
</p>

<p>
The light went out.
</p>

<p>
In place of the greyness, blackness fell.
</p>

<p>
Pat could hear the pounding of his own heart, and
another sound almost hidden by the noise in his
breast.
</p>

<p>
He thought that stairs were squeaking under a
stealthy foot.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br>
THE CRYSTAL
</h3>

<p>
"Have you an appointment, Madam?" asked the
elderly woman who opened the door of Madame
Veno's flat for Juliet.
</p>

<p>
She was a person of almost oppressively respectable
appearance, with grey hair parted in the middle,
gold-rimmed <i>pince nez</i> resting on a thin nose, and a
neat body clad in black silk.  If Madame Veno
needed a chaperon, her door opener was ideal!
</p>

<p>
Juliet had run upstairs so fast that she was breathing
hard.  Passing the office of the <i>Inner Circle</i> had
disgusted her.  She felt contaminated, almost ill;
but the sight of this woman was like a dash of cool
water on a hot forehead.
</p>

<p>
"I have no appointment," she answered.  "But—I
came because of a message.  I'm the Duchess of
Claremanagh."
</p>

<p>
"Please to walk in, Madam," said the woman,
without any evidence of being impressed.  "I will
give you a private room to wait in."
</p>

<p>
They stood in a hall, white-panelled, carpeted with
red.  The spruce black silk figure threw open a door,
and Juliet entered a tiny room, hardly more than a
closet.  The only furnishing consisted of a luxurious
easy chair, a table on which were magazines and a
box of cigarettes, and on the wall a mirror.  This
mirror was opposite the chair; and behind the chair
was a second door.  Any one opening that door would
see a reflected image of the sitter in the chair.
</p>

<p>
As Juliet sank into chintz-covered depths the
murmur of voices reached her.  She thought, in fact,
that she heard sounds from two rooms, one on each
side of the tiny cubicle in which she had been put
to wait.
</p>

<p>
"This little hole is for special visitors," she told
herself.  "Probably that woman was ordered to
bring me here if I came.  Madame Veno's room
must be on the right of this, and it's her voice I
hear on that side, talking to a client.  On the left,
I suppose, it's the ordinary waiting room, full of
people—jabbering to each other about Madame
Veno and the wonderful things they've heard about
her from their friends!  Or else it's a room where
they keep up the practice by manicuring clients'
nails.  But I'm sure she means to sneak me in ahead
of them."
</p>

<p>
Juliet was right.  In less than ten minutes there
was the click of a latch, and the door opposite the
mirror opened.  In the long glass her eyes met the
smiling ones of a pale, dark woman with a clever,
somewhat common face.  There was nothing mystic
about her appearance, but on the other hand there
was nothing meretricious, no attempt at Eastern
allurements.  Juliet had already guessed from the
ordinary furnishing of the flat that Madame Veno's
<i>metier</i> was clean, straightforward frankness, as
opposed to the cult of dim rooms, purple curtains, and
incense.  Now this impression was confirmed.  The
one false note was a heavy perfume such as some
women adore and are unable to resist.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to see you, Duchess," said the woman.
"I hoped you would call, and I'm going to slip you
in before the others who are waiting their turn.  They
won't know, so no harm's done!  Will you come into
my room?"
</p>

<p>
She spoke cheerfully, briskly, rather more like an
Englishwoman than an American, and Juliet wondered
if she were an English Jewess.
</p>

<p>
The door led into an alcove of a fair-sized room
decorated in green.  It was as little as possible like
the mysterious sanctum of an ordinary "fortune
teller" or crystal gazer.  Juliet had seen two or three
of these in several countries.  They had always been
Egyptian, or at least reminiscent of Leon Bakst.  This
might have been any woman's boudoir: but when
Madame Veno had drawn the thin green curtains,
the place seemed to fill with an emerald dusk, like
the dusk of dreams, or the green dimness under sea.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you think I'm not very 'psychic'," the
mistress of the room remarked, placing a chair for
her visitor at a table covered with a square of green
velvet.  "People <i>do</i> think that!  Then, when they've
consulted me, they're surprised sometimes.  They
get better results than from those who go in for what
I call 'scenery'.  You know what I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Juliet, "I suppose I do know."
</p>

<p>
"All I want to put me in the right frame of mind is
<i>green</i>," explained Madame Veno, "this kind of green
twilight."
</p>

<p>
She switched away the velvet covering from the
table.  Underneath was a cushion, and a crystal
which reflected the prevailing colour.  Then she
sat down opposite the Duchess.
</p>

<p>
"The Countess told you what happened when
I was looking into the crystal for her?" she
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Madame de Saintville said that you saw something
which concerned me.  But how did you <i>know</i>
it concerned me?"
</p>

<p>
"Your face came into the crystal.  I'd seen your
photograph, and recognized you.  Besides, I
felt—I <i>felt</i> that you were in great trouble."
</p>

<p>
"What else did you see in the crystal?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me look again, now you are here, and see if
the same thing comes."  As she spoke, Madame
Veno bent forward and gazed closely into the
transparent ball on a black base.
</p>

<p>
Some moments passed in dead silence.  Juliet
watched the woman's features, which became fixed
and masklike.  Suddenly Madame Veno started
slightly and began to speak.
</p>

<p>
"I see—a handsome young man—very charming.
It is your husband, Duchess.  He is lying ill in a poor
room.  It seems to be a kind of cellar.  He tosses
about.  He is delirious.  He calls for you.  I know
that, because at the same time I see the picture I
hear his voice.  The name is 'Juliet!'  I think he
has had an accident.  But I can't see what it was, I
only know that he has hurt his head.  I feel the pain
myself.  And I feel what he is thinking about:
you—and something else.  Ah, a rope of pearls!  Now I
get a whisper!  It comes to me from his thoughts.
He went in search of something that was lost—a
thing of great value.  Yes, the pearls!"
</p>

<p>
"Did he get them?" Juliet asked, mechanically.
She had little if any faith in the woman, but a faint
thrill ran through her.  She could not help being
slightly impressed by the seeress's change of manner,
and the hypnotized look in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"He got them—and then they were taken away.
But they are in the house where he is.  It is not a
good house.  It is a house of thieves.  Ah, I <i>must</i>
find out where it is, or I can do you no good.  Or
else—if I cannot find the house I must will the man who
has got the pearls to communicate with me.  I see
him plainly."
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't he communicate with <i>me</i>?" asked
Juliet.
</p>

<p>
"Will power doesn't act like that," exclaimed
Madame Veno.  "I could create a cord between
another intelligence and my own, not between two
outside intelligences.  Ah, the picture has faded
from the crystal!  But it will come again.  And for
the moment we've seen enough.  I have the man's
face clearly before my eyes.  I will concentrate upon
him as I have never concentrated before!  I feel
sure of the power to draw him to me."
</p>

<p>
"How?" Juliet enquired.
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell yet.  He may be impelled to consult
me about his future, to have his 'luck' foretold.
That's the line I will work on, in exerting influence.
I shall remember his face from the crystal.  I can't
make a mistake!  Once I get him here I shan't
hesitate to use hypnotism.  If that succeeds, I'll
'phone you to come round at once."
</p>

<p>
"With a detective," said Juliet.
</p>

<p>
Madame Veno's face changed, flushing slightly
over its sallowness.  "Oh, no, Duchess!" she
exclaimed, emphatically.  "<i>That</i> wouldn't do at all.
Women in my profession can't encourage detectives
to come spying into their methods.  So far I've
never had any trouble.  But I've had to be very
careful.  Detectives are the Enemy!  I shall be
very sorry indeed to be disobliging, but I'm afraid I
must let this business drop unless you give me your
word not to bring a detective into it.  Indeed, I
think I must ask you not to bring in any third party.
If you promise this, I don't think I'm conceited in
saying I can positively make you an important
promise in return.  By my will power I will do for
you what no detective on this earth could do.  I'll
draw into your circle the man who has got your
husband lying helpless in his house—and who has
got your pearls.  Do you believe I am able to do this,
or do you not?"
</p>

<p>
"I—can't say I quite believe," Juliet confessed.
She might have been more definite, yet not have
gone beyond the truth.  She might have said, "What
I think is, that you're a trickster.  If there's
anything in this at all beyond mere nonsense, you know
where my husband is, and you're playing a deep
game for money."  But something warned the girl
not to say this.  She was <i>afraid</i> to say it—afraid
to make the seeress afraid!
</p>

<p>
If Pat had been kidnapped, and this woman were
a catspaw of those who wanted a ransom, Juliet
was willing to pay.  If only Pat were <i>true</i>—if only
he hadn't left her of his own free will for love of
Lyda, she would give every penny she had in the
world to get him back, and not grudge it!
</p>

<p>
She reflected hastily that, if Madame Veno took
her for a fool, it would be better to let it go at that
rather than risk losing a chance—possibly the only
chance—of saving Pat.  As for telling Jack and
Sanders secretly, this course must be decided later.
There was surely no more harm in deceiving such
a woman than in tricking a dangerous animal, so far
as moral principles were concerned.  The one question
was, could Madame Veno safely be deceived, or would
she find a way of <i>forcing</i> a promise to be kept?
</p>

<p>
That question was answered at once.
</p>

<p>
"I don't blame you," said Madame, with a good-natured
smile.  "These great forces of Nature are
beyond belief to those who haven't tested them.
But I know by experience what I can do.  I know
also what I can't do.  I can do nothing if the people
whose interests I serve work against me consciously
or unconsciously.  Now, I read your mind as I read
the crystal.  I see you're thinking whether or not
to make a mental reservation about that promise!
Well, I don't want to control you, Duchess, though
I <i>could</i> do so.  But if you bring any one into this,
the whole effort will be vain.  I might get the man
we want here.  I might hypnotize him to the point
of speaking out.  I might 'phone you.  And yet,
if you weren't alone, or if someone were spying
outside, my power over him would break like—that!"
she snapped her fingers together, her black eyes
holding Juliet's.  "Now," she went on when she'd
got her effect, "I'm going to give you a proof of
good faith.  My fee for a consultation—just an
ordinary one, not a special like this—is twenty-five
dollars.  No, don't take out your purse, Duchess!
I won't accept a cent unless I bring off the stunt.
The rest—is up to you."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Juliet on a sudden resolution.
"Let it be so.  I'll promise what you ask, and—I'll
keep my promise.  If you send for me, I'll come
alone.  And I'll tell nobody.  But—I'm not a child.
I must protect myself in some way.  When I start
for your place next time, I shall leave a letter for
my cousin, Captain Manners, to be delivered by
hand if I'm not back in two hours after leaving home.
In the letter I shall tell him everything.  But it
won't be sent if all goes right.  So if you play fair
you've nothing to dread."
</p>

<p>
"Unless the letter should be sent to your cousin
by mistake."
</p>

<p>
"My maid is a very intelligent woman," said Juliet.
"She doesn't make mistakes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll leave the letter with your maid!"
echoed Madame Veno.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Do you agree to the arrangement?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," returned Madame.
</p>

<p>
Juliet rose to go.  She was feeling intensely
excited, if not really hopeful.  Even if there were a
plot, it seemed as if this might be the best way of
setting to work, and she saw herself beating Sanders
as a detective.  So far he had made only trifling
discoveries: fingerprints on the safe which told
nothing, since they were Pat's and Lyda Pavoya's;
there were no clues which might solve the mystery
of Pat's disappearance, or lead to finding the lost
pearls.
</p>

<p>
As for Jack, he was <i>Lyda's</i> man now!  He believed
the story which explained the fingerprints.  She,
Juliet, might soon show these two men that alone
she had accomplished more than either in solving
the double mystery.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br>
THE BARGAIN
</h3>

<p>
Two days passed; and small as was Juliet's faith
in Madame Veno, she did not stir from the house lest
the woman should telephone in her absence.
</p>

<p>
The strain of constant suspense was like a screw
tightening her nerves to breaking point.  Her
irritation grew against Jack, who persisted in warning
her that she would repent her suspicions of Lyda
Pavoya.  To his mind apparently the dancer's
story accounted for everything.  Lyda had
volunteered a statement that she had touched the safe
after Claremanagh opened it, and she had offered
to give Sanders her own fingerprints in order that
they might be identified with those taken on the door
of the safe, the only ones found there with the
exception of the Duke's.  Even this fact—that there
should be no other marks visible—didn't prejudice
Jack against the Siren.  According to him—and
(<i>he</i> said) to Sanders—the <i>real</i> thief or thieves had
used rubber gloves.
</p>

<p>
As for Sanders, he tried to calm the Duchess's
impatience by assuring her that everything possible
was being done.  He even had a theory.  But, of
what comfort was that to her, as he refused to tell
her what it was until—or if—he could obtain positive
proof?  It hardly interested Juliet that he should
have cabled Monsieur Mayen and learned in reply
that there was no scratch on the duplicate ring given
Mayen by Pat.  She hadn't for a moment supposed
there would be!  Of course it merely made matters
worse that Mayen should be left-handed, and that a
specimen seal he sent by cabled request should have
an entirely different appearance from those on the
covering of the packet.  Also, it seemed stupid rather
than intelligent that Defasquelle should be watched.
The detective admitted that the Frenchman seemed
above suspicion.  He had begged the Duke to open
the packet in his presence, which alone proved his
innocence, as Sanders couldn't help seeing.  Besides,
the French police had replied to a wired demand for
Defasquelle's <i>dossier</i>, by saying that he was a person
of unblemished character.  He appeared to deserve
the trust reposed in him by Monsieur Mayen; had
saved up a little money and was engaged to a pretty
girl with a good <i>dot</i>, the daughter of a hotel keeper
in Marseilles.  Not only that, Defasquelle was
remaining in New York for the purpose of giving what
aid he could.  Altogether, Juliet considered that
Sanders' activities were disappointing, and Jack's no
better.
</p>

<p>
She refused to meet Lyda and talk with her in
person as Jack advised her to do, and between her
sense of being deserted and her desperate anxiety
for the truth about Pat, she found more and more
that her thoughts clung to the broken reed of hope
held out by Madame Veno.
</p>

<p>
At last, when she was making up her mind to see
the woman again without waiting longer, the message came.
</p>

<p>
Juliet was in the act of answering a letter from
Nancy Van Esten, begging her to be at the dress
rehearsal for the "great show" which was to benefit
the Armenians.  There was an undertone of friendly
insistence which Juliet understood very well.  Nancy
knew what people were saying about Pat and Pavoya
and the pearls.  If she—Juliet—refused to attend
this rehearsal to which all her most intimate "pals"
were going, everyone would draw certain conclusions.
She hated to go, but had written to say that she'd
"drop in about five o'clock"—the rehearsal had
to be in the afternoon, as the roof garden theatre
was wanted in the evening for the last night of a
revue—when the telephone bell rang almost in her
ear.  She picked up the receiver from the writing
table, and her heart leaped at the sound of Madame
Veno's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you yourself, Duchess?  Yes?  Well,
<i>he's here</i>!  Can you come around at once?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Juliet, and putting down the receiver
had begun to get ready, when she remembered the
letter which ought to be left for Jack.  There was
no time, after all, to write details.  She ought to have
had the note ready for emergencies, but it hadn't
occurred to her till now.  Hurriedly she jotted down
the address of Madame Veno and a request to Jack
to send there.  Then, when she had scrawled
"Captain Manners, Tarascon Hotel," and sealed
the envelope, the Duchess rang for her maid.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going out, Simone," she said.  "It's now
four-thirty.  If I'm not back by six-thirty it will
mean that—that I must miss an appointment with
Captain Manners; so at that time take this to his
hotel yourself.  He tells me that he's always at home
between six-thirty and seven-thirty, so he's sure to
be there.  But if not, you can ring up Mr. Sanders
at his private address, which I'll jot down for you,
and ask him to call for Captain Manners' letter
which concerns his business as well.  I expect to
come in much sooner, however—in which case you
will simply hand this envelope back to me.  You
quite understand?"
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand, <i>Madame la Duchesse</i>,"
echoed Simone, pinning on her mistress's hat, and
handing her a pair of gloves.
</p>

<p>
So well did she understand that, the moment Juliet
was out of the house (the car having been ordered),
she examined the back of the said envelope.  In
her hurry Juliet had not sealed it firmly.  The flap
was still wet, and came loose with almost ridiculous ease.
</p>

<p>
Simone had been somewhat surprised by the
Duchess's instructions (her reason for wishing to
acquaint herself with the contents of the letter) but
she was still more surprised by the letter itself.
</p>

<p>
The Duchess was going to Madame Veno's,
evidently to keep an engagement already made,
and it would seem that she considered herself in
some danger.  Could Madame Veno mean to give
away Mademoiselle Amaranthe's connection with the
<i>Inner Circle</i>?
</p>

<p>
Simone told herself that this was an absurd and
far-fetched suspicion, because it was not probable
that Madame Veno knew anything about her activities.
Besides, why should the woman—even if she
knew them—betray valuable secrets of the paper
and its best correspondents?  It was but an idea
born of an uncomfortable conscience—another name
for fear.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Juliet was admitted to Madame Veno's flat by the
respectable creature in black silk who had impressed
her so favourably two days before.  Again she was
taken into the cubicle of a private waiting-room,
and there Madame came at once, from her own room.
</p>

<p>
"He's still here!" she announced, having closed
the door.  "Everything is wonderful—but different
from what I expected."
</p>

<p>
"Who is the man?" Juliet abruptly asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I haven't been able yet to make
him tell me that.  He seemed so obstinate that I
thought I'd better extract more important details
first, in case in his struggles not to obey I should
lose mind-control of him—which does happen now
and then in such experiments."
</p>

<p>
"You mean to tell me that this man—whoever
he is—actually came to you from heaven knows
where because you willed him to come, and that you
hypnotized him to find out about my husband?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean just that," answered Madame Veno,
triumphantly.  "I've done this sort of thing before.
It's the secret of my success over other psychics.
I've found out that your husband was kidnapped,
just as I thought.  As for the pearls, so far as I
can understand, he had them on him.  Anyhow,
they're in these people's possession.  But you'd
better come into my room and talk to the man."
</p>

<p>
"Is he still hypnotized?" Juliet wanted to know,
irritated by her feeling that she was being deceived,
yet eager and curious.
</p>

<p>
"No, not now.  I've released him from the
influence.  He was going pale about the lips, which
shows a weak heart, and I was scared.  I can't take
big risks of that sort!  But when I explained what
I'd got out of him, and when I'd even made him put
on paper a short statement of his own handwriting,
he saw that he might as well be frank——"
</p>

<p>
"If the statement was signed, you must have got
his name.  And if not, what use is it?"
</p>

<p>
"He <i>thinks</i> he's signed it, for I covered up the
place where the name should be as if accidentally,
and snatched the paper away as though I was afraid
he'd grab it from me.  It was when I was willing
him so hard to sign that he began to look queer.
So I had to give it up."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Juliet.  "Well, take me into the next
room, and let me try what <i>I</i> can get out of him!"
</p>

<p>
"You can get everything out of him, Duchess,
and you can get back your husband and your pearls.
That is, if you're willing to pay the price this man
asks.  Even in his sleep he was firm about that, and
he hasn't told where the Duke is."
</p>

<p>
Juliet did not believe that the man knew where
the Duke was.  It was so much more likely that the
whole business was a trick to extract money and—give
nothing of value in return!  Still, she was more
eager to see the occupant of Madame Veno's room
than she had ever been to see any one—except Pat,
in the blessed old days.
</p>

<p>
The green curtains were drawn, and though
twilight was falling out of doors the only lamp was a
small green-shaded one on the table of the crystal.
The man who stood facing the two women as they
entered was in shadow, all except his hands, which
showed white and large, crossed on folded arms.
</p>

<p>
It was an instant before Juliet realized that
something more than shadow obscured the features.  Then
her piercing eyes made out that a layer of black
crape was drawn across them as far up as the
forehead, as far down as the mouth.  Beneath this mask
a beard protruded like a fringe, but Juliet told
herself it might be false.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you have masked yourself!" exclaimed
Madame Veno.  "He wasn't masked when I left
him, Duchess!"
</p>

<p>
Juliet made no comment, though if the man and
woman were in collusion it was probable that
Madame lied.
</p>

<p>
"There's no objection to my being masked, I
suppose?" said the man.  "I have a right to
protect myself."
</p>

<p>
"Does he speak rather like an Englishman, or do
I imagine it?" Juliet wondered.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> don't object," she said aloud.  "I don't care
who you are if you can give me news of my husband,
and if—if you can bring him back to me."
</p>

<p>
"I can give you news now," the man replied.
"And you can have him back to-morrow night if you
choose."
</p>

<p>
"What are your conditions?" Juliet asked.
</p>

<p>
"One million dollars for the Duke and the pearls."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said the Duchess.  "And what for the Duke
without the pearls?"
</p>

<p>
"We don't treat separately."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!  And what if I refuse to treat at all?"
</p>

<p>
"In that case, you'll never see your husband again
on this side the grave."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you'll murder him if I don't pay ransom!"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  This is the Duke's own affair.
He's in it with us.  That is"—the man spoke
quickly, when anger flamed on Juliet's face and he
must have feared that she would cease bargaining
for a man capable of "holding up" his wife—"that
is, he's in it to this extent: he's taken an oath not to
give us away.  He was hurt in an accident—an
affair neither he nor you would like to have come
out—and I and a friend of mine saved his life.  When
we'd done that, as we're poor men we didn't see why
we shouldn't get something for ourselves.  We're
amateurs at these things, my mate and I, and we were
at odds how to approach you, Madam, without
risking trouble.  Then I had a 'hunch' to consult this
lady.  Dreamed about her, felt I <i>must</i> come!"  Madame
Veno gave Juliet a look.  "Now I find she
was mesmerizing me or something of the sort.  But
she's given me good advice, and she's brought you
and me together, so maybe all's well that ends well."
</p>

<p>
"Where's my husband?" asked Juliet.
</p>

<p>
"Where I live.  And you could have me followed
all around New York without finding out where that
is.  I'm up to every dodge of that kind, I can tell
you!  But what my friend and I—the Duke standing
by us because of what we've done for him—what
we propose, is this: you get hold of a million dollars
without telling any one what the money's for.  We'll
know if you play us false.  We have our spies.
It <i>must</i> be all in notes.  Then, if this lady—Madame
Veno—is willing to see the thing through, you'll
bring to her flat the whole sum, only with the
<i>notes cut in two</i>.  That plan is to prove my good
faith.  An hour after the Duke shall arrive—with
the pearls, in an auto—at your own house.  And
the remaining halves of the notes shall be handed to
the chauffeur by you in person before your husband
leaves the car.  Does that scheme look good to you?"
</p>

<p>
Juliet paused for an instant, but not to consider
the money question, for she would have given not
one million but all the millions she possessed to have
Pat with her, alive and safe.  Nor did she now care
a straw whether or not these two creatures were in a
plot together.  She hesitated only because it seemed
too good to be true that Pat should be given back to
her so easily.  She had suffered so much, had realized
so bitterly her need of him—guilty or innocent—that
she was actually dazzled by the man's offer.  And
when she had calmed herself by drawing a deep
breath or two, she answered:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it <i>seems</i> good to me!"
</p>

<p>
"Then it is good, all right!"
</p>

<p>
"How soon—can you do this?"
</p>

<p>
"How soon can you get hold of the money?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow.  Of course it's too late to-day."
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow then.  Come here at this same time.
Can you manage that?"
</p>

<p>
"I will manage it," Juliet said.  She remembered
that she had written to Nancy van Esten, meaning
to attend the rehearsal.  The letter wasn't posted
yet, but she would send it, and go to the theatre
for a few minutes.  From there, she would come here
to Madame Veno's.  No one could think then that
she had avoided meeting Lyda Pavoya, but if she
had a pressing engagement to keep, it wouldn't be
<i>her</i> fault if there were no time for introductions!
</p>

<p>
Besides, Jack Manners and Sanders were supposed
to be coming to-morrow afternoon, to discuss some
new detail in the Duke's study—what, Juliet didn't
know.  The rehearsal would give her an excuse for
absence while they were there, and as it was to meet
Lyda, Jack would be pleased to have her go.
</p>

<p>
"Remember, Madam, if you don't keep this
business strictly to yourself, the Duke won't materialize,"
the man in the mask went on.  "I assure you—not
on my honour, because that's a minus quantity
to you, but on your husband's—you can take my
word for this.  And furthermore, if you attempt to
trick us you'll never have a chance again."
</p>

<p>
"If there were as little chance of your tricking me,
as of my tricking you," Juliet exclaimed, "I should
be happy."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Be</i> happy then!" retorted the man.  "The
thing's settled.  I'm off.  And I'll tell the Duke
that you send him a good message."
</p>

<p>
He was out of the room before Juliet had realized
that he meant to suit his action to his word!  With
a wild impulse she would have sprung after him to
ask other questions, but the door slammed in her
face.  She was too late.  And besides, what would
have been gained by keeping the man a moment
more?
</p>

<p>
"I don't think there's anything further to do or
say.  But let him go quietly," Madame Veno
advised.
</p>

<p>
Juliet turned upon her.  "I believe you're in
this!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
The elder woman smiled indulgently, as at a
petulant child.  "My dear, I'm <i>not</i>!" she said.  "But
I can't prove that, if you don't want to take my
word."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, it doesn't matter!" Juliet sighed.
"What do I owe you for—your services?"
</p>

<p>
"What you think they're worth.  Pay me to-morrow,"
Madame replied.
</p>

<p>
To-morrow!  It seemed that Juliet could not live
till then!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br>
OLD NICK
</h3>

<p>
"I wish to heaven the scent of Pat's tobacco
weren't so d—d strong on that handkerchief in the
packet.  It's the blackest bit of evidence against
him!" Manners was saying to the detective, in
Claremanagh's study, when a tap came at the door.
</p>

<p>
The two locked themselves in for their occasional
seances in this room, and Jack himself answered the
knock.  He was about to scold Togo for disturbing
him (a thing strictly forbidden to all except the
Duchess) when the sight of Lyda's handwriting
pencilled on an envelope caused him to bite back the
words.
</p>

<p>
"Who brought this?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"A boy, sir," replied the Japanese.  "He is from
some theatre.  He said he went first to the Tarascon
Hotel, but they told him you'd left word to have you
called up here for anything important, so he came
round."
</p>

<p>
"Is he waiting for an answer?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  He was in a hurry to get back.  He
said there was no answer."
</p>

<p>
Jack retired into the study with the letter and
carefully, gently opened the envelope.  Even though
he was eager to know what Lyda had to say, he
couldn't deal roughly with anything she had touched.
This was not the only letter he had had from her,
but it made his heart beat as if it were the first.
</p>

<p>
"My dear friend," she wrote with pencil, evidently
in haste, "I have something very important to
tell you.  I cannot put it well in a letter.  But it
has to do with the Duchess, your cousin.  She may
be running into some danger.  I should like to save
her from that if I could!  Come to the theatre and
see me for a few minutes.  I shall be free at six
precisely, after rehearsing my new dance of the 'Swan
and the Cygnet' with Mrs. Van Esten's little girl.
Then I shall have a few minutes for you.  Meanwhile,
however, if you have time after getting this,
try to make your cousin's maid tell if she knows
where her mistress has gone.  Yours ever—Lyda P."
</p>

<p>
This was all.  But to Jack Manners it was sweet
as the perfume of an Eastern garden by moonlight—her
perfume!  It was all he could do to wrench his
mind from entranced thoughts of Lyda, to concentrate
them upon Juliet.  Poor Juliet!  He understood
now why he hadn't suffered at seeing her after
her marriage, or cared a single rap!  It was because
he'd never been in love with her really, except as a
dear, rather trying cousin, and because what he'd
called "love" had worn off even before that, like
thinly spread gilt on gingerbread!  He had not known
what love was till the night when Lyda Pavoya's
eyes said to him with their first blinding look, "You
are <i>the</i> man; I am <i>the</i> woman."
</p>

<p>
He believed in her utterly now, and if he had not,
he would have wished to kill himself.  To know her,
a good and glorious woman, made the splendour of
life.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Juliet has gone to the dress rehearsal of
the roof-garden show," he remembered.  That was
the word she had left with Togo to give him and
Sanders on opening the door for them.  But—Lyda
was at the rehearsal!  And she hadn't seen Juliet.
Before sending such a message to him she would
have made certain that the Duchess hadn't arrived!
He would have Simone down at once!
</p>

<p>
But Simone—the report came—was not in the
house.  She had gone out with Admiral Beatty, the
Duchess's bull-dog.  Neither Togo nor Huji could
say when she was likely to return.  But Togo made
a suggestion.  Nickson, the Duke's English valet,
might know something of her movements.
</p>

<p>
"Nickson!" echoed Jack, surprised.  "This is a
new development, isn't it, Nick knowing anything
about Simone?  I had an idea there was no love lost
there."
</p>

<p>
Togo ventured, on this encouragement, to smile
dryly.  At heart he had as little affection for
Mademoiselle as Old Nick had.  He would have liked to do
her an ill turn in payment of many snubs, if it could
be managed safely.  "There is not much love,
Captain," he said.  "Perhaps that is why Mr. Nickson
watches Mademoiselle when she takes the dog for a
walk."
</p>

<p>
"Is he afraid she'll do Beatty harm?" asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know, Captain.  Mr. Nickson has not
much talk.  But perhaps he would answer some
questions."
</p>

<p>
"Is he in the house?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Captain.  I noticed he left soon after
Mademoiselle, soon enough to see where she went—as
he often does these days now His Grace is gone,
and Mr. Nickson has not so much to keep him busy.
But he is back."
</p>

<p>
"Ask him to come here," said Manners.  He
spoke gravely, and as the respectful Togo retired,
threw Sanders a puzzled look.  "Is there anything
in this?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I've been wondering myself," vouchsafed
the detective.
</p>

<p>
"You knew Old Nick was dogging Simone's
footsteps?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I didn't know why.  I've been trying
to find out."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"By having the said footsteps dogged on my own
account."
</p>

<p>
"You've had Simone shadowed?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  But that doesn't necessarily imply
suspicion.  I'd be a poor sort of chap at my job if I
didn't have every servant in the house shadowed."
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!  And without a word to me or my
cousin!"
</p>

<p>
"I can't bother you two with every detail.  Besides,
she or you might have objected, and that would
have made things awkward all around."
</p>

<p>
"H'm!  I see.  Well, where does Simone go?"
</p>

<p>
"She goes, quite naturally, to a French café where
she can drink her native coffee and chat with
compatriots in her native tongue."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much in that, then, it would seem."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Nothing much.  Or—so it 'would seem',
as you say."
</p>

<p>
"All the same you're putting two and two together?"
</p>

<p>
"That would be a mistake, from my point of
view.  The great thing is, to see whether two and
two put themselves together."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I come in, sir?" asked the man known to the
household as "Old Nick," when his tap on the door
left ajar for him had not been answered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, come in," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Old Nick" was in reality not old.  He might
have been anywhere between thirty and forty,
and was the typical British soldier turned valet.
There was, however, a glint in his eye at times when
fixed on a person detested, which made his nickname
not inappropriate.
</p>

<p>
"Togo thinks you may know when Simone is
likely to return," Manners explained.
</p>

<p>
"She generally does about this time, sir.  I'm
expecting her any minute."
</p>

<p>
"Is it her movements or Beatty's that interest
you?"
</p>

<p>
Nickson swallowed discreetly.  "May I speak
out, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what we want you to do."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I was with 'is Grice one wye or another
all through the war, and there's nobody to me like
'im—never was nor never will be.  So there it <i>is</i>!
And when 'e just vanished as you might say without
so much as tippin' the wink to me, I was dead sure
'e 'adn't gone of 'is own accord.  So I sets my wits
to work the best I could, and I listens to talk and I
reads all that blinkin' newspaper rot.  Thinks I,
looks as if them beastly pearls has somethin' to say
in the business.  So I asks meself: '<i>Oo's</i> walked off
with 'em, if any one, and is 'is Grice doin' a flit in
the 'ope of trackin' the bloke down?  If them pearls
was ever <i>in</i> this 'ouse, they must 'ave gone out again.
<i>'Oo</i> could' a' done the trick?'  Well, I never trusted
Mam'selle the wye 'er Grice did.  She 'ad the run o'
the plice.  It was just on the cards she might o'
laid 'er 'ands on the combination for openin' the safe.
'Well, I puts <i>that</i> in my pipe an' smokes it.  Strikes
me she goes out a bit more reg'lar for 'er prominides
with Beatty since that French Mounseer brought
'is packet o' pearls, than she used to do.  So I 'as
the curiosity to foller at a respectful distance one dye,
an' sees m' lidy step into a French restorong.
Not long after, comes along Mounseer of the pearls.
I was sent to meet 'im at the dock, but missed 'im
there, 'cause o' some mistike about 'is initials w'ere
you wites for the Customs men.  But I seed 'im
'ere at th' 'ouse later when I comes 'ome to report to
'is Grice.  I recognized 'im alright.  The question
to my mind was w'ether 'e'd chose that restorong
'cause 'twas French or cause o' Mam'selle."
</p>

<p>
Jack's eyes flashed to Sanders, who smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You and I have been rivals in this game, Nickson,"
he remarked.  "What conclusion did you come
to about Mademoiselle?"
</p>

<p>
Nickson flushed.  "Didn't know I was on your
pitch, sir.  But if yer asks me, in my opinion 'e comes
for <i>'er</i>.  Or else she comes for <i>'im</i>."
</p>

<p>
"A cat may look at a king!" said Sanders.
"They're compatriots.  Why shouldn't they meet?"
</p>

<p>
"On the other 'and, w'y <i>should</i> they?" ventured
Nickson.  "<i>I</i> wouldn't if I was 'im.  And see 'ere,
sir, beggin' your pardon, I know you're a detective, in
a privit wye.  I've told you all I done.  But t'ain't
all I <i>want</i> to do.  I want to find 'is Grice.  If you
and the Captain make any frontal attack, so to
speak, will you tike me along?  I'd give my life for
th' Dook.  And I might come in 'andy, 'oo knows?"
</p>

<p>
"Who knows, indeed?" echoed Sanders.  "But
you shall have the chance of finding out when the
time comes.  And it may come soon—any day, any
hour, even any minute.  Now, if you think
Mademoiselle's due back, I suggest that you leave us, as
we've sent for her here.  If there's anything in
your suspicions, we don't want her to smell a
rat."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, sir, and thank you, sir!" said
Nickson.  "I'll be off and leave all clear."
</p>

<p>
"So, you actually suspect Simone?  <i>And</i>
Defasquelle!"  Jack turned on Sanders when they were
alone.
</p>

<p>
"I can't go as far as that—yet.  There's no
evidence against them—not even circumstantial.
There's no crime in a flirtation between a man and
woman, both of the <i>Midi</i>, thrown together in a
foreign land.  I meant to spring this on you only
when or if I had cause to be sure.  Up to date, my
indoors man at Rudin's—that's the French place
in Twelfth Street where they meet—hasn't been
able to overhear a word between the two, though he
speaks French.  He's acting as a waiter there now.
He has instructions to ring me up if he gets onto
anything queer.  And I always leave word at
home and the office where I'm going to be."
</p>

<p>
This conversation, following Lyda's letter, had
keyed up Manners' nerves.  He started as rather a
sharp knock sounded on the door.
</p>

<p>
It was Simone.  She was very neat and <i>chic</i>, and
led Beatty, whose bored look suggested that he had
been denied his proper share of exercise.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Monsieur le Capitaine</i>!" she purred; and bowed
discreetly to the detective.  "Togo says Monsieur
has asked for me the moment I am home.  I come.
But the dog——"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind the dog!"  Sanders caught the word
from Jack.  "We've some questions to ask you,
Mademoiselle.  Please stay where you are."
</p>

<p>
His tone was rough, and he had put on a professional,
hectoring air.  There had been no time to
arrange a plan of action, but Manners guessed what
was in Sanders' mind.  He meant to try scaring
Simone; and he wanted to do it off his own bat.
Jack trusted him, and was willing to keep out of the
business.  Though the Frenchwoman's black eyes
appealed to him—as her mistress's relative—against
the rude stranger, he sat still and lit a cigarette.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br>
THE THIRD DEGREE
</h3>

<p>
"To begin with, where's the Duchess?"
</p>

<p>
"At a rehearsal, Monsieur, of an entertainment
Madame van Esten has got up.  Mademoiselle
Pavoya will——"
</p>

<p>
"We don't want to hear about her.  The Duchess
isn't at the rehearsal."
</p>

<p>
"Then I do not know where she is.  It is her
affair, not mine."  Simone looked the picture of
injured innocence.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you <i>don't</i> know," agreed Sanders.  "But
you see, you've made so many of her affairs your
affairs, it's hard to tell where you draw the line."
</p>

<p>
The French maid turned pale in rather a repulsive
way she had, beginning at the lips, which she bit
to keep their colour.  From her looks she might have
been furious—or frightened.
</p>

<p>
"I do not understand you, Monsieur," she almost
spat.
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter much.  What does matter
is, we understand <i>you</i>."
</p>

<p>
Under her black-dotted veil Simone's olive sallowness
greened.  "Monsieur accuses me of—something?"
Sanders grinned with the utmost cruelty.  "Well,
what do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I think a person has perhaps told lies about me,
Monsieur!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" the detective leapt in his chair as if he had
caught her—as if she had given him a chance for
which he'd waited.  "Ah!  What's the name of
that person?"
</p>

<p>
The Frenchwoman began to feel sick.  Her fears,
though acute, had been vague.  Suddenly they
became definite.  She floundered.  So much
depended on saying the right thing that she was
terribly afraid of saying the wrong one.  She glanced
at Captain Manners again, but he had taken up a
paper.  To her horror it was the <i>Inner Circle</i>, which
Sanders had bought and brought in to discuss.  Her
knees turned to water.  She could not help giving
a faint gasp.  Her eyes were fixed on the "Whisperer's"
page, which was held up—as if purposely.
Both men saw the stare: and into the minds of both
sprang the same thought.
</p>

<p>
Jack had had it before.  He had even hinted it to
Juliet, who laughed it to scorn, and remarked that
she knew Simone better than he could possibly know
her.  Sanders had had the thought, and mentioned
it to Manners.  But there was no proof; and the
Frenchwoman's "shadower" had never seen her go
to the office of the <i>Inner Circle</i>.  As for
letters—Sanders had put Togo onto watching for them.
Simone had sent out none at all from the house.
Yet now that one bleak glare at the open paper,
and both men were as sure as if the woman had
confessed.
</p>

<p>
"You think your editor has been talking, eh?"
the detective said.  "That's as may be.  Anyhow,
we <i>know</i>."
</p>

<p>
The telephone bell rang.  Jack took up the
receiver.  "Yes, Mr. Sanders is here," he replied to
some question.  "He'll speak with you in a second.
Hold the line."
</p>

<p>
Sanders bounded to the 'phone.  "Yes—yes—good!"
were the only words he said.  But Jack
knew he was speaking to his man at the café.  Then
he turned again to Simone.  "Come here and call
your friend Defasquelle," he sharply ordered.  "Tell
him he must turn up at his house at once or there'll
be a disaster for you both."
</p>

<p>
Simone grasped the back of a chair, and clung to it.
"I cannot, Monsieur," she gulped.  "I know Monsieur
Defasquelle only by seeing him here.  I——"
</p>

<p>
"Don't waste words," Sanders cut her short.
"It'll be the worse for you if you do.  You've just
been with him now, at Rudin's.  Call him up at his
hotel."
</p>

<p>
"If—if I will not?" she stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want to go to prison while he's left
free—to <i>marry his girl in Marseilles</i>?"
</p>

<p>
That was a chance shot, but it found its billet.
</p>

<p>
"He <i>has</i> no girl in Marseilles!" Simone shrilled.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, he has.  I have his <i>dossier</i> from the Paris
police.  If you get him here and make him tell the
truth, I promise you that marriage won't take place."
</p>

<p>
"I will call him," said Simone, sickly pale.  She
flitted across the room to the telephone.
</p>

<p>
Sanders rubbed his hands, and nodded to Jack.
But Jack was glancing at his wrist-watch.
</p>

<p>
"What am I to do?" he asked the detective in a
low voice.  "The time's almost here for me to keep
my appointment with Mademoiselle Pavoya."
</p>

<p>
"Go to it!" said Sanders.  "I'm equal to Simone
and Defasquelle.  Now I've got proof enough to
bluff on—my waiter man 'phoned that the pair were
talking about the pearls and apparently blackguarding
each other!  I'll strip them of their secrets like
a tree of ripe fruit.  But look here, I have a 'hunch'
that there's more in this <i>Inner Circle</i> business than
meets the eye.  Simone's been a catspaw.  There
may be wheels within wheels.  When you go to
meet Mademoiselle Pavoya take my tip and accept
Old Nick's offer."
</p>

<p>
"What, have him with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, wherever Pavoya sends you."
</p>

<p>
"She may not send me anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"I think she will send you somewhere.  Meanwhile,
I'll pump Simone and Defasquelle dry.  When
you get back I may have the pearls in pink cotton!"
</p>

<p>
Manners was torn.  He wished to hear what Simone
said over the telephone.  He wished to stay and
witness the scene through between her, Defasquelle,
and Sanders.  But most of all he wished not to be
late for Lyda.  <i>Nothing</i> was worth that!
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Jack arrived at the theatre just after Lyda had
finished rehearsing a dance which she herself had
arranged for the charity fête with Mrs. Van Esten's
spoiled little girl.
</p>

<p>
Mademoiselle Pavoya was in her dressing room,
he was told, and was expecting him.  He went there
quickly, afraid of being caught by someone he knew
on the way, and forced to stop and talk nonsense,
for the place was like a rabbit-warren—alive with
pretty women and men who thought they were
Society incarnate.
</p>

<p>
Lyda wore the swan costume she had worn the
first night of their meeting—or one much like it;
and the thought of that wonderful night thrilled him.
How had he lived before that time?  Yet he had
gone out of her presence to doubt her truth, her
honour!  Never could he forgive himself for that, never
could he worship her quite enough to make up for
those hours of disloyalty.
</p>

<p>
She held out her hands to him, and he crushed
first one then the other against his lips.  "My Swan
Goddess!" he exclaimed.  "You're too marvellous
like this.  I can hardly believe you're flesh and
blood—that I'm not dreaming you.  I love you so much!"
</p>

<p>
She drew her hands away, and pushed him back
when he would have taken her in his arms, wings
and all.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you <i>are</i> dreaming me!" she smiled,
"Dreaming the woman you think I am.  And—you're
not to do <i>that</i>!  My hands only!"
</p>

<p>
"Yet you said you cared!  You said you'd never
felt for any man as you felt when our eyes first met."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I said that when you'd confessed doubting
me, and begged forgiveness, and vowed that nothing
on earth or in heaven—or the other place—could
ever make you doubt again.  I owed you some
confession in return."
</p>

<p>
"Then it <i>was</i> true?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was true——"
</p>

<p>
"And is still?"
</p>

<p>
"But—of course!  I do not change.  Yet we are
to be friends and nothing more until all is made
clear—until even your cousin believes in me and doesn't
think you'd be better dead than loving Lyda Pavoya.
If that day could ever come!"
</p>

<p>
"It will come—soon.  Oh, Lyda, remember that
first night—at your house.  You let me hold you
in my arms then."
</p>

<p>
"But that was as a <i>friend</i>.  You understood, I
know!  I was so stirred, so hard pressed, I wanted
protection from someone sincere.  And you were
the sincerest man I ever saw."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did understand.  I do now.  And—I
won't bother you, Lyda—though it's hard work,
this friendship business to a man who worships a
beautiful woman as I worship you.  But it's a
bargain: friendship till—the day.  May it be
to-morrow!"
</p>

<p>
"Amen!" she echoed, with one of her fleeting smiles
that came so seldom.  "Now let us talk not of
ourselves but of your cousin.  We ought to have begun
with her!"
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Because there may be danger.  I'll tell
you quickly all I know.  You have met a friend—an
acquaintance—of mine, the Comtesse de Saintville?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes—wife of a diplomat of sorts, isn't she?
I've heard you were intimate."
</p>

<p>
"That isn't true; but she has Polish blood, and
for that or some other reason she likes to come to
my house.  I have been able to do her a good turn
now and then.  I wouldn't tell this to any one except
you, <i>mon ami</i>, but she's a great bridge player, and
loses more money than she ought.  Lately she got
into a bad—what you call scrape.  She asked me to
lend her a thousand dollars (you see, she dared not
let her husband know!) but I couldn't.  It was when
I was putting aside every <i>sou</i> for Markoff.  I could
do nothing except promise to help later.  I do not
love Sonia de Saintville, yet I am sorry for her.  I
was afraid that in desperation she would do some
stupid thing!  The other day I had a windfall.  A
friend in Paris who'd borrowed fifty thousand francs
sent it back to me.  I'd never expected to see the
money again!  So I 'phoned Sonia that now I could
let her have the thousand dollars.  She answered that
a thousand would no longer be of use.  But two
thousand would save her.  From the way she spoke,
I understood that things were very grave.  I said
she should have the two thousand.  She came to my
house and I gave it to her in notes.  I hadn't seen her
for days, and she was looking ill—changed.  I spoke
kindly to the poor thing, and she broke down.  It is
the confession she made which will interest you, my
friend.  You would never guess!  She had got into
the power of that <i>Inner Circle</i> band."
</p>

<p>
"They were blackmailing her?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, in a queer way.  Did you ever suspect that
Mr. Lowndes—'Billy Lowndes' I hear him called—was
for something in that paper?"
</p>

<p>
"Good lord, no!  <i>Billy Lowndes</i>!—Not that I ever
liked him.  But I didn't think he was as big a rotter
as that!  He was in love with my cousin Juliet,
hard hit, before she married.  And by a sort of
coincidence Lowndes' sister Emmy—Lady West (you
may have met her war-working in Paris or London)—made
rather an ass of herself over Claremanagh."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps that partly explains—some things, if
we can patch them together.  Listen!  It was at
Mrs. Billy Lowndes', Sonia said, that she lost most
of her money.  There's a set there that plays very
high.  They make the Lowndes' flat a sort of private
club.  Sonia was dunned—and frightened of her
husband.  Billy Lowndes offered to lend her the
whole lot.  She thought, how good-natured!  But
soon she learned it was not goodness.  He wanted
something.  The condition was that she should get
the Duchess of Claremanagh to go and consult a
palmist, crystal-gazer person, a Madame Veno.  Did
you ever hear of her?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Yes!  By Jove, her name's on the building
of the <i>Inner Circle</i>!  The plot thickens."
</p>

<p>
"But how?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Sanders and I have caught my cousin Juliet's
maid.  We're sure it's she who gave away things to
the 'Whisperer.' Sanders is putting her through the
'third degree' now.  I couldn't stop to hear it out.
I was due here.  Besides, it looks as if the
woman—Simone—was mixed up in the disappearance of the
pearls, with the chap who brought them from
France—Defasquelle.  Perhaps this Veno person
is in the affair, too.  And the whole business may be
one—with ramifications."
</p>

<p>
"That is what I've wondered—since Sonia confessed
to-day what they made her do.  She was to go
to the Duchess, and tell her that Madame Veno had
seen Claremanagh in the crystal—that she could help
her find him.  Sonia suspected something queer.
She was sure at once that Lowndes was on that horrid
paper—perhaps editor—of that vile 'Whisperer'.
And she'd heard the story about his being in love
with your cousin when she was Miss Phayre.  So she
told him she couldn't do this commission.  Then
Lowndes lost all his good nature.  He threatened
that the 'Whisperer' of the <i>Inner Circle</i> might get
some new material from him to whisper about: that
there'd be paragraphs hinting of her debts and the
ruin of her husband's career.  That would have been
the end of all things for Sonia!  So she consented,
after all.  She called on the Duchess and told her
that Madame Veno wanted to see her."
</p>

<p>
"When was that?"
</p>

<p>
"Three days ago."
</p>

<p>
"Juliet never breathed a word to Sanders or me.
She left us in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"She would!  Most women would.  I should have
let you know before, but Sonia told me only to-day.
I wrote at once and asked you to come."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, my White Swan.  Many women
in your place would have sat still and let poor Juliet
go to the devil for treating you in the cattish way
she has."
</p>

<p>
"I've no grudge against her!  I should have done
so in her place, if—if the man had been you, instead
of Claremanagh."
</p>

<p>
"Darling!  You expect to keep me at arms'
length after that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes—yes!  Listen.  The Duchess went to Madame
Veno."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"The Veno woman herself was to inform Sonia
if she didn't turn up.  In that case Sonia was to urge
the Duchess.  She—Sonia, I mean—was forced to
go to Veno's place as if to have her hand read, because
<i>they</i> wouldn't risk anything in writing.  Luckily she
had to make only one visit, because the very first
time she was told the Duchess had been there.  She
was to come again on the third day.  That was all
arranged, though Sonia imagined that the Duchess
didn't <i>know</i> this.  She was to think the arrangement
was made later.  But the third day is to-day.
Sonia thought the first call the Duchess made was
late in the afternoon, and something was dropped
about the 'same hour next time'.  I believe she must
be at Veno's at this moment.  And if those <i>Inner
Circle</i> people are in the thing, and it's a plot of some
sort——"
</p>

<p>
"I'll go there now!"
</p>

<p>
"What, to the <i>Inner Circle</i> office?"
</p>

<p>
"Not first, anyhow.  Maybe later.  That
depends!  But now, to Madame Veno's."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm worried!"  Lyda put out her hands, and
laid them on his khaki-clad arms.  "They say
these <i>Inner Circle</i> people may be a nest of crooks!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt 'they' are right for once!  But I'm
not going alone."
</p>

<p>
"I thought your detective was busy with the maid
and the pearl carrier."
</p>

<p>
"He is.  But you know Old Nick?  You must!
You couldn't have known Pat without Old Nick."
</p>

<p>
"Good Old Nick!  Of course I know him—since
Paris, when Claremanagh was ill at my house."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Nick's going 'over the top' with me, as a
volunteer.  I don't know whether I shall find
anything for him to do, but if so, he'll be ready!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes—yes!  He'd do anything for Claremanagh."
</p>

<p>
"And even for Claremanagh's wife.  Good-bye,
my darling.  Wish me luck."
</p>

<p>
"I do—I do."
</p>

<p>
"A kiss to speed the wish?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Only my hand.  Wait!"
</p>

<p>
"How long—in God's name?"
</p>

<p>
"Till—the Duke's found—and the pearls."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br>
THE MIDDLE DOOR
</h3>

<p>
"Tell her two gentlemen for a consultation,"
Jack Manners announced at Madame Veno's door,
Nickson at his heels.
</p>

<p>
"Madame can see no more clients this afternoon,
sir," replied the neat woman in black silk.  "She
closes for business at six, and——"
</p>

<p>
"It's not six yet," cut in Jack.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, but she has a lady with her now.  I have
orders to receive no one else."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you forget those orders, and persuade her
to make an exception for us?"  As he spoke, Manners
took from his pocket a cigarette-case and
extracted from it a twenty-dollar bill.
</p>

<p>
It would have been simple—physically—to push
past the spinster-like person in black, but Jack could
more easily have got over a high stone wall.  Luckily
she liked the look of the bank-note.
</p>

<p>
"I might try, sir," she hesitated.  "If trying's
worth twenty dollars to you."
</p>

<p>
"It is," he replied, promptly.
</p>

<p>
The money changed hands.
</p>

<p>
The woman in black silk ceased to bar the entrance
with her neat person.
</p>

<p>
Jack walked into the flat, Nickson after him.
</p>

<p>
Again there was hesitation.  Evidently their
guide was not sure where she ought to put them.
Jack imagined that he could read her thoughts.
She feared to lead the forbidden visitors into the
ordinary waiting-room.  Either there was someone
there, or something that ought not to be seen; or
the room was next the one where Madame Veno
was with her "last client"—Juliet!  In that case,
words might be overheard through a wall or
door.
</p>

<p>
As he and Nick were invited into a dining room,
Manners counted three doors on the opposite side
of the hall, all closed.  Behind one of those he
believed Juliet to be hidden at that moment, probably
in process of being blackmailed.  He made up his
mind quickly as to a plan of action, already
half-decided on between Nickson and himself.
</p>

<p>
"We're in no great hurry, so long as we see
Madame sooner or later," he told the woman who had
let them in.  "We wouldn't think of having you
interrupt her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I shouldn't dare do <i>that</i>, sir!" she broke in,
pocketing the twenty dollars.  As she spoke, Jack
caught a glance of awed respect which she cast
across the corridor.
</p>

<p>
"<i>The middle door</i>," he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," he said, aloud.  "We'll wait.
How'll you know when the client goes?"
</p>

<p>
"I expect Madame will ring for me to open the
front door, and let the lady out.  That's what she
usually does."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, when the lady's gone speak for us."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the black-silk woman wondered why the
nice young gentleman hadn't given her ten dollars
to try, and a promise of ten more if she succeeded.
But that was his affair.  Personally, she didn't
expect to succeed.  She was not acquainted with
Madame's private business, but there was certainly
something of the first importance "on" this
afternoon.  No clients had been admitted since four
o'clock except the beautiful blonde young lady who
had announced herself the other day as the Duchess
of Claremanagh or some name like that.  Before
she was due two gentlemen had come up and hadn't
given their names.  But Madame had expected
them, and they were still with her when the Duchess
arrived.  The black-silk woman had seen those
gentlemen before, though never together.  She had
not much curiosity about them, for she was not of a
curious disposition.  That, Madame said, was one
reason why she had engaged her.  She had been
a stewardess on board ship, but had disliked the sea,
especially during the war, when she had been
torpedoed once.  Madame had crossed with her on
three occasions, and the last time had offered her
this place.  Some things she had seen had surprised
and even shocked her a little, but she was well paid,
and dry land was a good deal better than that nasty
grey wet thing, the sea!
</p>

<p>
She felt that she had done right in putting these
two new gentlemen into the dining room.  If
Madame firmly refused to see them, they might
possibly be smuggled away without her knowing they
had actually been let into the flat.
</p>

<p>
"That elderly party isn't going to stay on watch,"
Jack said to Nickson, when they had been shut
into the commonplace little room where Madame
Veno ate her meals.  "There's no uneasy curiosity
in that meek make-up."
</p>

<p>
"That's wot I was thinkin' myself, sir," agreed
Old Nick.
</p>

<p>
"We're in luck so far," Jack went on.  "It's time
to begin reconnoitring."  He went to the door.
"If that decent body is in the hall, I shall ask her
what time it is, and say my watch has gone
slow—which is more than my heart has!"
</p>

<p>
Nickson grinned.
</p>

<p>
Jack peered out into the white-and-red corridor.
Nobody was there.  The red glass lamp suspended
from the ceiling looked to him like a mass of clotted
blood.
</p>

<p>
He took two steps across to the middle door, and
listened.  Then he returned hastily to Nick.  "They're
in there!  I heard the Duchess's voice.  Sounds as
if she were angry or frightened, or both.  And there
are two or more men.  You and I have got to open
the door, locked or unlocked."
</p>

<p>
"That's it, sir!" said Nickson.  "But it won't
be locked.  Why should it?  They don't suspect
nothin', and if there's two men, 'er Grice couldn't
get past 'em.  You let me make a dash and see wot
'appens, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"No," Jack decided, "the dash is my job.  You
stand by, and if there's any dashing from the wrong
side of the door, you'll know how to stop it, male or
female."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir!"
</p>

<p>
Manners went again to the middle door.  As he
moved, Nickson closed in behind him, a substantial
bulk, and in his eyes the light which made "Old
Nick" his right name.  He stood in such a position
that if any one rushed for the front door or even some
back exit, escape could be made only over his body.
He saw that Captain Manners took hold of the doorknob
with his left hand.  The right hand was in the
outer pocket of his coat, and Nickson knew what else
was there.  A similar thing was in a similar pocket
of his own coat.  It had been given to him by the
Captain, whom he now liked and respected next to
the Duke.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Manners turned the handle and flung
the door wide open with such violence that it struck
the wall.  He strode into the room.  Nickson
blocked the doorway, but seeing with one glance
that there was a door leading to another room, he
took a step back to guard both.
</p>

<p>
It was a very green room—green as arsenic, he
thought—lighted by one lamp, like a big emerald,
on a centre table.  Looking in from across the
threshold, however, Nick could see four figures besides
Manners'.  There was the Duchess, tall and strangely
white in a black dress and wide hat.  There was
another woman without a hat, also in black; a big,
common hussy she looked to Nickson, with an eye
like a fierce snake's.  And there were two men.
</p>

<p>
About the pair an odd thing was that they had
some thin black stuff tied over their faces.  Captain
Manners went for one man—the one who seemed to
show fight, and when the other (who hadn't spied
Nick yet) made for the door, Nick received him in
open arms.
</p>

<p>
The big woman squealed, and the Duchess shrank
back against the wall, then started forward again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jack!" she cried, "they mustn't be killed!
They know where Pat is.  They say if they aren't
back there soon, someone will put an end to him!"
</p>

<p>
Nick saw the woman, Madame Veno, he didn't doubt,
spring for the electric-light button, but dragging his
man with him, he was upon her like a tiger.  One
hand was enough for the man, who must have been a
coward for he splashed about like a jelly with Nick's
fist in his collar.  The other hand seized Madame's
arm as it was stretched out, and twisted it sharply.
She gave a shriek, and sat down on the floor.  Then
Nick became conscious of a stealthy intelligence in
the jelly.  It was feeling toward his pocket, <i>the</i>
pocket.  But before the groping fingers reached their
goal Nick had snatched out the Browning, and
pressed the muzzle against a crape-covered forehead.
</p>

<p>
There wasn't much time for looking round just
then, but Nickson had done observation work in
the war.  The sixth of a second showed him that
Captain Manners had reached this identical stage
in his programme: which meant that each had a man
at his mercy.
</p>

<p>
"Take your mask off," ordered Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Same to you, my beauty," echoed Nick.
</p>

<p>
The two obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"Bill Lowndes!" cried Manners.
</p>

<p>
"Know this brute, sir?" enquired Nick.
</p>

<p>
"I do!" Juliet gasped.  "Oh! you horrid wretch!
And Bill Lowndes!  I shouldn't have dreamed——"
</p>

<p>
"They're nightmares, both of 'em," broke in
Jack.  "Now, Juliet, don't be scared.  That's all
rot about Pat being done away with.  Nick and I
are going to save time by making these—these
<i>skunks</i>—tell us where he is.  But we've a minute or
so to spare.  They've kept Pat safe, I bet, for the
sake of the ransom they meant to get out of you.
There's a third-degree stunt going on in your house.
Sanders is grilling Defasquelle and Simone.  It all
comes back to this building that's like the web of a
black spider—the <i>Inner Circle</i>—and we'll repeat that
third-degree stunt here.  Who's this man you call
a wretch?"
</p>

<p>
"His name's Piggott," Juliet panted.  "He—was
editor of a hateful paper in London—<i>Modern
Ways</i>—almost as vile as the <i>Inner Circle</i>.  Emmy West
introduced me to him.  She said he wasn't bad really—if
I'd meet him he'd put nice things in his paper
instead of horrors—especially about Pat.  I said
'Yes' for Pat's sake—Emmy insisted so.  He came
to Harridge's, where I was staying, but before he or
I had time to speak, Pat was shown in.  He gave one
look, and begged me to go out—to leave this man
to him.  I had never seen Pat like that—and I went.
I never even heard the wretch's voice or I'd have
recognized it, I think.  He came here and talked
to me three days ago—with this mask on.  Now Bill
Lowndes comes with him.  I don't know yet how or
why he should be mixed up——"
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Jack.  "It's because they're both
concerned with the <i>Inner Circle</i>, on the floor below.
They've had Simone in their pay, selling them news,
and as for the pearls——"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! if you'll let my husband go, I'll tell you
everything!" wailed Madame Veno; stumbling up
from the floor.  "That's my husband, Sam Piggott.
He's got nothing to do with the <i>Inner Circle</i>, except
a little interest he's bought, because the owner is my
step-brother.  I'm English, and Sam's Irish, and
our being in this business is an accident.  It was all
the Duke's fault and Markoff's fault——"
</p>

<p>
"Shut your mouth," grunted the big man whom
Old Nick held—a man few others could have held at
all.
</p>

<p>
"Shut yours—that's more to the point!" said
Nickson.  Apparently he meant the pistol's point.
And Piggott was silenced.
</p>

<p>
"Will you let him go if I tell you things?"
repeated the woman, shuddering at Nick's gesture.
</p>

<p>
"That depends on how much you can tell,"
decided Jack, coolly.
</p>

<p>
"I can tell <i>everything</i>," she moaned.
</p>

<p>
"Begin by telling where the Duke is."
</p>

<p>
Both men started, but collapsed.  Madame Veno
choked and went on:
</p>

<p>
"He's in a room downstairs—in the basement.
He's been there all the time.  What happened was
like this: The Duke came one night to the office—I
mean of the <i>Inner Circle</i>.  He'd heard the editor
would be there.  I may as well tell you he'd got an
anonymous letter to say so.  It was found in his
pocket.  The Duchess's maid or Mademoiselle's
French pal is sure to have sent it, wanting to get the
Duke out of their way.  And they <i>did</i> get him out!
It was the night of the first 'Whisper' about the
pearls and Pavoya calling at the Phayre house.  The
Duke got into the place by a trick—sent word by an
office boy that he had information to give.  He was
let into a room divided by a partition from the one
where my step-brother was—the editor.  You have
to say what you've got to say by telephone there.
You don't see any one.  But the Duke guessed
who was on the other side.  He put the chair on
the table, and climbed up, so he could get over the
partition.  He'd wrenched off the receiver from
the 'phone, to hit my step-brother with.  When he
was going for him my husband heard the row, and
ran in from another room.  He didn't make any
noise, but came up from behind and cracked the
Duke over the back of the head with a big ruler.
He had a right to do that, because the Duke
horsewhipped him publicly in London for what he'd
published in <i>Modern Ways</i>, and spoiled England for
us both.  That's why we came to New York, and
I took over the 'Madame Veno' business.  I was
'Madame Ayesha' in Bond Street, and wore Egyptian
dress.  I told you it was an accident we were mixed
up in this.  It wasn't my husband's fault.  He
<i>had</i> to defend his brother-in-law against a cowardly
attack like that!
</p>

<p>
"As for Mr. Lowndes, he hated the Duke for
marrying Miss Phayre—just as Lady West (who
used to send us lots of news about folks she didn't
like in London and Paris) hated Miss Phayre for
marrying the Duke.  Mr. Lowndes is one of the
'Whisperer' lot.  I mean he's one of several men
who put together the 'Whisperer' stuff that comes
out under one name.  He was in the office that
night, and so was Markoff the Russian!  Your
private detective was after Markoff——"
</p>

<p>
"More about him and the others by-and-by,"
Manners cut her short almost gently, "Nick,
would you like the job of going down to look for the
Duke?"
</p>

<p>
"I would that, sir!" Nickson answered.  "I'll give
this big chap a smash the way he did 'is Grice, and
put him out o' count for while I'm way."
</p>

<p>
"No need for that.  See if he's armed."
</p>

<p>
Nickson "went through" his prisoner's pockets.
There was only a pocket-knife, for Piggott and
Lowndes had expected to meet no one more
formidable than the Duchess of Claremanagh.
</p>

<p>
Lowndes was also unarmed.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," pronounced Jack.  "I and a
Browning can keep the pair and Madame, too, in
order.  No, on second thoughts take her down with
you.  She'll show you the way, won't you, Madame?"
</p>

<p>
"Needs must, when the Devil drives," she snapped.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for the compliment," laughed Jack.  "If
any one knows the gentleman by sight, it must be
you!"
</p>

<p>
"I shall go with them," Juliet said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" agreed Manners.
</p>

<p>
Madame Veno turned and glared at her.  "You
gave us away in spite of your promise.  You deserve
to see what you <i>will</i> see down there.  A dead
man—killed by your husband.  You'll save your dear
Duke only to have him sent to the chair."
</p>

<p>
Juliet gave her look for look.  "I didn't give you
away.  I did not dream my cousin was coming
here!  And I'd know by your face, even if I didn't
know Claremanagh, that he has killed no man.  If
there's a dead man where my husband is, someone
else committed the murder."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear! your Grice!" shouted Nickson,
before he could remember to be respectful.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Juliet heard herself laughing.  Then she
began to sob: "Oh, Pat—Pat!  Nick, take me to
him!"
</p>

<p>
Nickson flung Piggott across the room, and grabbed
Madame Veno by the arm.
</p>

<p>
The next thing the Duchess knew, the door had
shut behind them.  Jack was left alone with the
two men.  But Juliet had forgotten Jack.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br>
THE WHOLE OF THE SECRET
</h3>

<p>
Madame Veno—alias Mrs. Sam Piggott—had a
key to the door of the janitor's flat.  She, her
husband, and their associates could come and go as
they chose when the janitor was away or upstairs.
</p>

<p>
"You won't get anything out of your husband,"
she said to Juliet as the three went down, she leading
with mingled defiance and reluctance.  "He hasn't
come back to his senses yet.  It wasn't so much the
blow—mind you, my husband was within his rights,
defending his brother-in-law from assault!—it wasn't
the blow so much as the fall.  The Duke fell on the
back of his head.  It was concussion.  We had a
doctor in—a friend of ours we could trust.  And we
weren't going to let you know till we were sure he
was out of danger—ready to be moved.  If he has to
stand his trial for killing Markoff, why——"
</p>

<p>
"How does a man with concussion of the brain
commit murder?"  Juliet's question stabbed like a
stiletto.  By this time they were at the door of the
basement flat, and Madame Veno was fumbling
with a bunch of keys, Nickson's eyes upon her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally the killing was done before the
concussion," Madame sneered.  "The Duke hated
Markoff because of Pavoya.  Perhaps he had reason.
But that won't help him with a jury!"
</p>

<p>
Juliet could have struck the woman and trampled
her under foot.  She turned upon her in the dimly lit
passage so fiercely that the nervous fingers jumped
and let fall the key.  "You fool!" the Duchess said.
"You told me I should see a dead man here.  Yet
according to your own story my husband was struck
down the night after I saw him last.  One doesn't
keep a dead man in a flat for weeks!"
</p>

<p>
Madame Veno drew in a sharp breath, and
mumbled something which Juliet could not hear.  It
was easy to deduce that the story of Markoff's death
by Claremanagh's hand was an impromptu effort—an
inspiration which didn't quite "come off!"  The
woman had suddenly caught at a desperate chance.
The Duke, having lost all memory of events, could
be made to believe what they chose about himself.
And if the Duchess and her friends could be got to
credit the tale, the Markoff affair would be simplified.
</p>

<p>
He had been known to Madame's husband and stepbrother
for years, even before the war, when he had
fed <i>Modern Ways</i> in London and the <i>Inner Circle</i>
in New York with rich titbits of scandal concerning
the Russian Court.  He had told Piggott that Russia
had a grievance against the Claremanagh family in
connection with the Tsarina pearls; that this treasure
ought to be returned to the Crown; and Piggott had
suspected that Markoff was "out" to get it if he
could.  This visit of his to New York was for some
reason <i>sub rosa</i>.  His passport was made out for a
merchant of skins named Halbin; but he had called
upon his two old acquaintances and offered for sale
the most intimate personal secrets of Trotsky and
Lenin.  The brothers-in-law had guessed that he
wanted the Tsarina pearls for himself, if they could
be got, as he had once pretended to want them for
the Russian Crown.  So, when by amazing luck
they found themselves in possession of the famous
rope, their first thought was to bargain with
Markoff-Halbin.  He had risen to the bait, and had made an
offer.  It sounded satisfactory, but the money was
not forthcoming.  A "friend" was to produce it.
Meanwhile, when it was learned through the "leak"
at the Duchess's that Sanders sought Markoff,
shelter was given him; also the "benefit of the
doubt."  But little doubt remained when he tried to
steal the pearls!  As for the consequences of this
attempt, they were upon the man's own head!  And
at worst, the doctor would certify that death had not
been the direct result of a blow, but of heart failure.
</p>

<p>
The end had come the day before the Duchess was
invited to Madame Veno's; and had it not come,
Madame de Saintville might have been left in peace
till her help was wanted in some other direction.
With Markoff dead, and his problematic "offer"
wiped from the slate, the best remaining hope was
the Duchess.  Claremanagh would not be able to
testify against the man who had struck him down—would
not even know that Sam Pigott had revenged
himself at last for the caning episode in London.  He
and the pearls could be handed over to the Duchess;
price, a million dollars; and no one would ever know
where and how he had spent those weeks missing
from his calendar.
</p>

<p>
The scheme had been in fine working order up to
the moment when that middle door had suddenly
opened!  Madame Veno thought bitterly of the
mistake they had all made in sending for the Duchess.
The thing might surely have been managed in
another way!  But it was useless to cry over spilt
milk—a million dollars' worth of spilt milk!  They
must be grateful if the Enemy held his tongue, and
they kept out of jail.
</p>

<p>
She laughed when the Duchess called aloud,
"Pat!  Where are you?  It's Juliet, who loves
you."  She was so sure that the cry would be answered by
silence, for there was a dead man in one room, an
unconscious man in another.  But there was no
laugh left in her when Claremanagh's voice rang out,
clear and sane, "Hullo, my darling!  Here I am!"
</p>

<p>
He had been shamming, then!  How much had he
heard?  How much could he tell?  <i>How much did he
remember</i>?
</p>

<p>
Juliet flew in the direction of the beloved voice.  It
was heaven to hear it after the hell she had suffered!
There were two doors opposite each other.  She
tried the first.  Locked!  But the key was there.
It turned, and she threw the door open only to slam
it shut with a stifled gasp—for on the bed was a long
shape covered with a sheet.  It was the body of
Markoff, of whom she had heard so much of late
from Jack and Sanders, though till now—when he
had ceased to live—she'd hardly believed in his
existence.
</p>

<p>
Again Pat called.  She realized that he was in the
room opposite, and in less than a minute she was
with him—in a grey room where a pale Pat lay in a
squalid bed.  He sat up, a strange, unkempt figure:
the immaculate Claremanagh unshaven, his smooth
hair rumpled; a torn shirt open at the throat, instead
of those smart silk pyjamas in "Futurist" colours
which she'd often smiled at and admired!
</p>

<p>
She rushed into his arms.  He was strong enough
to clasp her tight.  "Oh, my Pat, my dearest one!"
she sobbed.  "I have you again!  Say you're not
going to die.  Say you still love me!"
</p>

<p>
"I adore you.  And I'm not going to die.  Perhaps
I came near it.  I don't know.  But this is
new life.  And, Juliet—<i>I've got back the pearls far
you</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh—the pearls!  I'd forgotten them."
</p>

<p>
"I hadn't.  You see, it meant a lot to me to
prove to you that it wasn't I who walked off with
them.  Darling, I suppose you wouldn't be here
now if you didn't know how I got to this place?"
</p>

<p>
"I know partly.  I know you went at night to
the <i>Inner Circle</i> office to punish that Beast.  And
the horrible London man, Piggott—his
brother-in-law—struck you from behind——"
</p>

<p>
"Was it like that?  I wasn't sure what happened,
and I don't know yet where I am.  But since I woke
up to things, I've lain still, and listened when they
thought I was nothing but a log.  I wasn't strong
enough to do much.  I had to lie low!  But there
was a row about the pearls.  Markoff was here—hiding,
I think.  How these people got the pearls I
haven't made out.  They had them, though—and
Markoff tried to steal them instead of buying as he'd
promised.  He fell in a fit or something, and died.
I heard a doctor talking—a pal of the people here.
The night Markoff died they were squabbling over
the pearls, a woman and two men in the next room.
I heard them say where they were kept—in the
room where they'd put Markoff's body till they
could get rid of it.  They'd no idea I'd come alive.
At last, to-day when they were all out, and the
coast clear—it can't have been two hours ago—I
struggled up and got the pearls—beneath a loose
board in the floor under the carpet.  They're inside
this mattress now.  I was planning how to make
my 'getaway' when I heard your voice.  Jove!
This has been a bad dream.  But thank God it's
over for us both.  You'll have to believe in me when
I give you the pearls."
</p>

<p>
"Give me your love—your forgiveness," begged
Juliet.  "I want nothing else."
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to take the lot!"  Pat almost
laughed.  "But as to forgiveness—why, darling one,
there's nothing to forgive!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Leon Defasquelle's look, when he saw Sanders
instead of the Frenchwoman alone, was in itself a
confession.  He knew he was trapped.  His dark,
southern face faded to the yellow green of seasickness.
Speechless, anxious-eyed as a kicked dog, he
would have backed to the door, but Sanders was
ready for that.  He stepped between him and the
hope of escape.  "It's all up, my friend," the
detective said, in his quiet voice.  Then, remembering
that Defasquelle had little English, he went on in
half-forgotten school French, a little slang thrown in
from novels he'd read.
</p>

<p>
"Your <i>chère amie</i> has split on you.  No good
getting out the pistol from your pocket.  Nothing
doing in that line!" (He showed his Browning.) "We
can settle this business without blood if you've
got common sense."
</p>

<p>
"That woman—that devil has told her side of the
story!" Defasquelle raged, with a look that longed
to kill.  "Now you shall have mine.  She was the
temptress.  She has ruined me."
</p>

<p>
"Liar!" shrilled Simone.  "Coward and deceiver!
You have a <i>fiancée</i> in Marseilles.  You let me think
you'd marry me!"
</p>

<p>
"You threatened to betray!  I had to defend
myself.  You made me a thief!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, accuse <i>me</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Because you are guilty!"
</p>

<p>
It was thus that Sanders heard the story, bit by
bit.  And patching together these torn rags of
recrimination he got the pattern of the whole cloth.
</p>

<p>
Simone had scraped acquaintance with her
countryman.  He had complained of the Duke's
carelessness and lack of consideration in refusing to
break the seals of the packet.  Then a dazzling idea
had come to Simone.  The packet, Defasquelle said,
had been flung into a wall-safe.  Simone knew all
about that safe!  She knew also where the Duchess
(as careless in some ways as the Duke) kept the
combination jotted down on a bit of paper.
Defasquelle could not be suspected (she pointed
out), as he had earnestly implored the Duke to open
the package in his presence.  Nor was there the
least danger for herself.  She was completely trusted.
It would be tempting Providence not to seize such an
opportunity of fortune!  As for "stealing," that was
not the word.  These pearls didn't properly belong
to the Claremanaghs.  They should have been
returned to the Russian Crown.  Now, there was no
Russian crown.  The pearls belonged to no one—unless
to those with pluck enough to take them.
</p>

<p>
According to Defasquelle, those were Simone's
arguments.  And he saw too late that she'd drawn
him into the intrigue instead of managing it alone,
drawn him in so as to hold him in her power—and
get a husband at the sword's point!  He, in his heart,
had thought of the girl at Marseilles.  The one
objection to him there was his lack of money.  The
girl's father accused him of presenting his prospects
in too rosy colours.  If the pearls could be disposed
of as Mademoiselle vowed they could even known as
they were, over the world, the future would be ideal.
</p>

<p>
Simone had opened the safe with the aid of her
mistress's memorandum, Defasquelle having gone
away and come back again.  To their surprise they
had found, on the same shelf with the packet, a rope
of great blue pearls.  At first Defasquelle had taken
them for the genuine ones, though the seals on the
packet appeared intact.  But Simone was an expert
in pearls, like the Duchess.  A simple test had
shown that the rope was a copy.  As for the clasp,
neither thought of the difference in the watching
eye; and it seemed to both that the "find" was
almost a miracle in their favour.
</p>

<p>
The Duchess—argued Simone—was unlikely to
suspect a substitution.  She would not test the
pearls, and might wear them for months or years
without guessing that they weren't genuine.
Meanwhile, Simone would leave her service, and never
need to take a place again.  She would go home to
France and live on her share from the sale of the
pearls.
</p>

<p>
The Duke being absent, and the Duchess, too, she
and Defasquelle could work safely in the study.
Simone had some red sealing wax; and the Duke's
famous ring lay on the desk where he'd left it after
displaying the design to Mayen's messenger.  Simone
had thought of everything—even to a pair of rubber
gloves which she used when cleaning her mistress's
gold toilet things.  These gloves she had put on
before touching the safe, the packet, or the seal ring.
And having opened the packet she had made
Defasquelle smoke one of the Duke's special brand
of cigarettes to scent the handkerchief wrapped
round the jewel case.  If worst came to worst, and
suspicion were excited, let it fall upon the Duke
himself, and Lyda Pavoya.
</p>

<p>
Then, that very night, suspicion <i>had</i> fallen!
</p>

<p>
The Duchess had discovered that the pearls were
false.  Simone had overheard snatches of talk
between her and the Duke, and it had seemed well to
mention Pavoya's visit in order that Lyda might be
suspected from the beginning.  Also, Simone had
felt it safe to give the whole story to the <i>Inner
Circle</i>.  The Duke and Duchess had quarrelled, so
why not?  She would get extra pay.  And soon she
would be leaving the Claremanaghs forever.
</p>

<p>
One of her first thoughts in connection with the
pearls was to hint in the office at having secured a
great treasure, to sell for a comparatively low price.
If the invisible editor rose to the bait, as Simone
hoped he might, she would be saved much trouble
and danger: also she would have protection in case
of trouble.
</p>

<p>
She had been right about the bait; but once she
was in his power the man put on the screw, and too
late Simone regretted applying to him.  Defasquelle
reproached her bitterly, and they quarrelled, yet he
could not break free.  Simone held him in chains, as
both were held by the <i>Inner Circle</i>.  The fortune she
had visioned dwindled to a few thousand dollars
which were all the <i>Inner Circle</i> men would pay for
"stolen property."  This was maddening, because
the fortune would go to <i>them</i>.  There was nothing to
do, however, save consent.
</p>

<p>
It was by Defasquelle's suggestion, Simone vowed,
that she'd sent an anonymous letter to the Duke,
mentioning an hour when the illusive editor could be
found, and at the same time warning the editor
himself that violence might be expected.  If the
Duke were "smashed up" there would be just half
the danger to face in future; and Defasquelle
owed him a grudge for laughing at his first request
which, if granted, would have saved him from temptation.
</p>

<p>
So there, in its patched design, the great pearl
secret lay exposed!  Fitted in with the forced
confessions from the side of the <i>Inner Circle</i>, and
from what Claremanagh had overheard, it was
complete.
</p>

<p>
What to do with the guilty ones was the next
question.
</p>

<p>
Sanders being a private detective, not a member
of the police, considered that his obligation was to
his employers, not to the public.  He was going to
leave the decision to Captain Manners and the
Duchess—who were paying for his services.  If they
and the Duke wanted to pack the lot to prison, at
the price of a big scandal, well and good.  If, on the
contrary, the culprits were to be let off and silence
kept, it was the same to him.
</p>

<p>
Later, when he learned by telephone from Manners
what had happened in the <i>Inner Circle</i> building, he
did not change his mind.  He obeyed instructions
and ordered the Duchess's car to go there at once.
Fortunately night had fallen and the Duke, in any
sort of toilet, could easily be smuggled home.
</p>

<p>
"Claremanagh has the pearls," 'phoned Jack.
"And he'll soon be fit again—the two principal
things.  These blighters have got a dead man
here—Markoff—but they've a doctor's certificate testifying
that he died of heart failure.  Arrangements have
been made to bury him to-morrow.  We think, on
the whole, that the dead past had best bury <i>its</i> dead,
too!  No great crime has actually been done, as it
turns out.  But the scandal would be great, for a
number of innocent ones who don't deserve it.
What?"
</p>

<p>
Sanders grinned quietly.  He guessed <i>which</i>
innocent one was most in Manners' thoughts!
</p>

<p>
"Right!" he said.  "Though it seems a pity
that d—d <i>Inner Circle</i> should get off scot free."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I forgot to tell you.  It won't.  Pat not
only found the pearls, but overheard such a lot he's
in a position to turn blackmailer.  He's held up the
rotters.  They've had to sign a paper swearing to
mend their ways.  Lowndes is one of them; there's
an Irishman—compatriot of Pat's—from a London
rag, who slugged him.  And the <i>editor</i>—Gee! you'd
<i>never</i> guess who <i>he's</i> turned out to be."
</p>

<p>
"But I know!" said the detective.
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyhow, he's going to transform the <i>Inner
Circle</i> into a sort of <i>Inner Shrine</i>, if he keeps his
promise.  Lord!  Won't the next number be a
sensation?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes—make up to the public a bit for losing the
truth about the great pearl secret."
</p>

<p>
Jack laughed joyfully—his first happy laugh for
weeks.  And then, even from that unblest place,
the flat of Madame Veno, he could not omit calling up
Lyda, at her house.
</p>

<p>
She was at home, and answered: "Oh, I'm thankful
to hear your voice.  Is all well with the Duchess?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, also with the Duke."
</p>

<p>
"He's found?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  <i>And</i> the pearls.  So all's well with
everyone except me."
</p>

<p>
"Why not with you?"
</p>

<p>
"How can it be till you give me that promise?"
</p>

<p>
"But—since these things have happened, it's
yours already.  And—so am I.  You are <i>the</i> man.
I am <i>the</i> woman!"
</p>

<p>
"My goddess!" cried Jack through the
uncongenial telephone.  "I'm coming to you the
instant I'm free.  Juliet and Pat send you their love.
You've got all mine already."
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
