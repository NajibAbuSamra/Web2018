<p class="c001">It was not possible to always reproduce the flow of text around
the many figures and illustrations. These will appear in
approximately the same arrangement. Occasionally, numbered full
page illustrations appeared out of order in the
original.</p>

<p class="c001">On p. 164, the composite illustration includes Figures 312 through
322, and resists any attempt to reproduce the individual components.
It appears as a single image, with the original captions included
in the image itself.</p>

<p class="c001">The numbered figures 520, 521 and 522 appear in the text out of sequence,
though all references to them are correct. The sequence has been retained
here.</p>

<p class="c001">The single footnote has been moved to follow the paragraph in which

  <h2 class="c007">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="c008">This new century, bringing with it the strong, healthy,
independent, athletic American girl, makes a demand for
new opportunities for the exercise of both mind and body.
Resourcefulness and a wish to do things for one’s self are
American traits strongly developed in the girls as well as
in the boys; and, keeping step with their brothers, our
girls are walking steadily onward, with new hopes and
new ambitions in work and play, and are reaping new
rewards.</p>

<p class="c009">This book is the result of the authors’ earnest desire to
be of some assistance to their young friends by encouraging
them in their wish to do things for themselves, and by
pointing out some directions in which they may gratify this
ambition. Within its covers are suggestions for a wide
variety of things, useful, instructive, and entertaining, which
a girl may make and do, with wholesome and genuine pleasure.
The ideas that are worked out are essentially those of
the authors, and are not, as is often the case, derived from
other books. The drawings, too, are all original, as in
“The American Girl’s Handy Book,” to which this is a
companion volume.</p>

<p class="c009">In conclusion the authors wish to express their sincere
<span class="pageno" id="Page_vi">vi</span>thanks to the <cite>Delineator</cite> and the <cite>Woman’s Home
Companion</cite>, whose prompt and generous courtesy, in returning
such original drawings and material as were used
in their respective magazines, has greatly facilitated the
preparation of this work and added to its interest.</p>

</div><p class="drop-capi1_1">
This is an age when girls go to college
and engage in athletic sports;
when they have their manual training,
as boys do and are learning to
use their hands, as never before, in
all sorts of skilful work. The deftness
of their fingers is utilized not alone
in embroidery, or what was once
considered girl’s work, but in the
manufacture of many useful, artistic,
and beautiful objects once thought
beyond their reach. Our girls no
longer resort to the scissors to sharpen a lead-pencil or to
their brother’s chisel to pull out tacks; they are beginning
to know and appreciate the value of tools and are becoming
proficient in their use.</p>

<p class="c009">If you are one of these modern girls, girls of the twentieth
century, who like to use both brains and hands, a
little workshop stocked with a few good tools and material
for carpentry work will give you many hours of pure
enjoyment. The tool-chest, denied to girls of the past
generation, is yours for the asking; the manual training in
the public schools has given to many of you the advantage
of learning the use of saw, plane, and hammer, and your
<span class="pageno" id="Page_4">4</span>physical culture has produced the strength and energy for
this active work.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
<div class="nf-center c017">
    <div><b>The Workshop</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c018">Just a room, any room, that will afford sufficient light
for your work, that is all you need for a beginning. Having
the room you have a place for your first tool, if it is
necessary to collect them one at a time, and it is much
better to do that than to buy a cheap tool-chest. When
you have one tool make a place for it and keep it in its
place. A hammer, a saw, a hatchet, a sharp knife, a
screw-driver, a gimlet, and a rule are the first tools you will
need. The writer once made a very good mantel-board,
cleated at the ends with rounded corners, which has stood
the heating and drying process of many winters over an
open fire, without warping, and her tools were simply a
hatchet, a meat-saw, and a pocket knife. Of course, the
work would have been much easier and more enjoyable
had she possessed the proper tools, but this example serves
to show how few tools are absolutely necessary. A plane,
a chisel, and an auger-bit and brace will be needed later;
after that a gouge, a try-square, and a file. These you may
collect by degrees as your work grows more ambitious and
you feel the need of them. Hooks, nails, tacks, and screws
can be bought as required.</p>

<p class="c009">Have a hook for your saw and hang it up, lay your
plane on its side, make a rack for your small tools something
like Fig. 1, and have a box for your shavings. A shelf on
which to keep your boxes of tacks and other small articles
is indispensable; each of these boxes should be labelled and
kept in its place; in fact, to get the full enjoyment from
your workshop you must keep it in order and the tools just
where you may always expect to find them.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
<div class="nf-center c017">
    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span><b>What the Tools are for and How to Use Them</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c018"><i>The Hammer.</i>—A carpenter’s hammer is what you want,
not a tack hammer, and it should be of medium weight.
You are to use it in driving nails, in hammering things into
place and in various ways not injurious to the hammer.
The manner in which you hold this tool will make all the
difference in the way you drive a nail. The hammer
should be taken by the end of the handle and the head
brought down squarely on the nail-head, otherwise the nail
will slant to one side or perhaps bend.</p>

<div class="figcenter id003">
<img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_005-fig1.jpg" alt="" class="ig001">
<div class="ic003">
<p><span class="small">Fig. 1.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_6">6</span><i>The Saw.</i>—The panel-saw is best suited to ordinary work,
one having about ten teeth to the inch. Finer saws make a
smoother cut, and you will probably find use for several, but
one is enough to begin with. The saw is used for cutting
large pieces of wood and for cutting across grain, and special
saws serve for special purposes, such as sawing of
curves and cutting out keyholes. With pencil and rule
draw the line you wish your saw to follow. Stand above
your work so that you may see the pencil line; hold the
saw firmly in the right hand and with the left grasp the
board, allowing your thumb to rest on the saw, above
the teeth. This is to help guide the saw and to prevent
cutting your hand. Take light, short strokes at first, then
longer ones, using a little more force, and keep your saw
at right angles with the board. If your material is large
and heavy place it across two wooden horses, if light or
small it is best to use a mitre-box.</p>

<p class="c009"><i>The Hatchet.</i>—You will find a good medium-sized hatchet
with a sharp edge very useful, for cutting away or trimming,
but it must be used with care, for to chop too vigorously
will frequently split the wood. See that your hatchet does
not follow the grain of the wood unless the grain runs in
the direction you wish your cut to take.</p>

<p class="c009"><i>The Knife.</i>—Not a dainty pearl-handled pocket-knife but a
strong, well-made, sharp-bladed jack-knife, large enough
for all kinds of whittling. The knife is for fine cutting
that cannot be done with the hatchet, and when one learns
to whittle out various small articles much has been accomplished.</p>

<p class="c009"><i>The Screw-driver.</i>—It has been said that the feminine mind
cannot grasp the difference between a screw-driver, a cork-screw,
and a gimlet, and it remains with you to prove the
contrary. A poor screw-driver is one of the most exasperating
<span class="pageno" id="Page_7">7</span>of poor tools, and a trial to one’s patience and
temper; besides, it is of little use attempting to “make it
do,” for it seldom will do. The edge is usually
shaped like Fig. 2, and it slides and slips out of
the groove of the screw until it has turned and
worn down its edges and made the screw useless.
Fig. 3 shows the proper shape for a
screw-driver. The use of the tool is, of course,
to put in and take out screws, and it is well to
have two sizes, one for large, the other for
small screws. Remember that in putting in a screw you
turn it to the right, and to the left in taking it out.</p>

<div class="figright id004">
<img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_007-fig2-3.jpg" alt="" class="ig001">
<div class="ic003">
<p>Fig. 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 3.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c009"><i>The Gimlet.</i>—A medium-sized gimlet will answer your
purpose. Use it for boring small holes and for starting
holes for screws and large nails.</p>

<p class="c009"><i>The Rule.</i>—A rule is indispensable for measuring and laying
out your work. A two-foot steel rule is the most
useful, as it can be used both for measuring and ruling
straight lines. A light folding rule is easier to handle in
taking measurements, but you can make the other answer
both purposes.</p>

<p class="c009">In taking measurements be as accurate as possible, and
go over them several times to make sure they are correct.
In ruling a line use the bevelled edge of the rule, hold it
firmly in place with your left hand, and with a soft pencil
in your right draw a line close to the edge of the rule.
The wide, rather flat carpenter’s pencils are the best to use,
but any soft lead-pencil will answer.</p>

<p class="c009"><i>The Plane.</i>—There are several kinds of planes, but the
smoothing-plane will probably be all you will need, as you
will not be likely to attempt to handle unplaned wood and
will need the smoothing-plane only for finishing and
smoothing off.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>In using the plane hold it back of the iron (or blade)
with your right hand, place your left on the stock (or
wood) at the other end to help guide it, and push it forward
as far as you can conveniently reach, bring it back, tipping
it away from you in so doing, and take another stroke.</p>

<p class="c009">The farther the edge of the iron projects through the
stock the deeper will be the cut and the thicker the shaving.
To regulate this, tap on the stock at the forward end
and loosen the iron, then adjust it to suit your work and fix
it in place by driving down the wedge, which holds it, with
a few light taps.</p>

<p class="c009"><i>The Chisel.</i>—This tool has a bevelled edge and is used for
paring off the wood.</p>

<p class="c009">Unless you are quite careful there is danger of cutting
your left hand in using the chisel, and it is best not to try
to hold the work, but to fasten it in the vice; your left hand
placed on the tool will steady and control it.</p>

<div class="figleft id004">

<div class="ic003">
<p>Fig. 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 5.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c009"><i>Auger-bit and Brace.</i>—For drilling large holes the auger-bit
and brace are necessary. The bit resembles a gimlet in
its spiral edge, but is not wedge-shaped, and the hole it
makes is of unvarying size. You may have several bits for
large or smaller holes. The brace is a handle which fits
on the top of the bit, and makes it quite easy to manage.</p>

<p class="c009"><i>The Gouge.</i>—There are several kinds of gouges,
the difference being in the shape of the blade;
their curves vary from the shallow curve, Fig.
4, to the deeper one, Fig. 5. One with a moderate
curve will prove the most useful. As the
name suggests, the gouge is for gouging out
the wood where it is necessary to make a
groove, but be careful not to press too hard
on the tool at first, as one is apt to make too deep a cut,
and do not put your left hand in front of the blade.</p>

<p>Fig. 6.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c009"><i>The Try-square.</i>—The square is a metal strip which forms an
exact right angle and is used to test one’s work and keep it
“square”; it is also used
for ruling square corners.
Fig. 6 shows its
use in squaring off the
end of a board. Figs. 7
and 8 show how the
try-square will fit on an
edge that is perfectly square and will not fit an imperfect one.</p>

<p class="c009"><i>The File.</i>—This tool is not indispensable, but is useful for
smoothing off rounding edges and rough corners. Files for
metal and those for wood differ, and should not be used
indiscriminately. Rub the file back and forth over the surface
to be smoothed, but do not press on it too heavily. If
you are to use metal in your work a metal file is necessary.
For wood a slightly curved surface is best.</p>

    <div><b>The Carpenter’s Bench</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c018">When you can attain to a regular carpenter’s bench you
will indeed be happy, but until then use a strong kitchen
<span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>table that sits firmly on the floor or, better still, is fastened
so that it cannot move. Have a carpenter add sides
(<i>a</i>, Fig. 9), and a vice (<i>b</i>, Fig. 9). <i>See page 2.</i> You can hardly
get along without a vice, for it is impossible to hold some
of the work firmly enough without it.</p>

<p class="c018">These wooden horses are convenient for holding boards
when they are to be sawed, and for lifting work from the
floor. You should have
two of them, like Fig. 10,
made by the carpenter.</p>

    <div><b>The Mitre-box</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c018">This very useful contrivance
is simply three
pieces of narrow boards
put together in the form
of a box, having two
sides and a bottom, but
no ends or top. Eighteen inches is a suitable length, and
its height should be no greater than the width of your saw.
The mitre-box is used for holding the wood and guiding
the saw at any angle. In the sides of the box are slits running
from top to bottom, some passing diagonally, some at
right angles through the boards. Any carpenter can make
you a mitre-box; do not attempt one yourself, for to be of
use it must be accurately made in every particular.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
<div class="nf-center c017">
    <div><b>Choosing the Wood</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c018">It is well to know a little about what kind of wood to
select when you are buying your material, for if you wish
to make a durable article, one that will last long enough to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>pay for the making, you should not use wood that will warp
and in a little while spoil your piece of work.</p>

<p class="c009">The heart-wood is always the best: this consists of boards
cut from the heart, or centre, of the tree; they are harder,
dryer than others, and less likely to warp or twist. The sap-wood,
which is the part nearer the surface, contains so much
sap it is difficult to season and will generally warp.</p>

<p class="c009">Select the boards yourself if possible, and see that they
are planed equally on both sides and have square edges. Do
not take a cracked board, a board with knot-holes or loose
knots, or one that seems damp or musty, and be sure, if you
can, that all your wood is well-seasoned.</p>

<p class="c009">Soft woods are best for your purpose at first, and while
pine is very good, white-wood is better, and is easily
worked.</p>

<p class="c018">And now that all is ready and the workshop well stocked,
what shall we make? What shall we not make, rather?
Suppose we begin with a few simple pieces of furniture
suitable for a summer cottage, a log-camp, or a play-house.
We will use boxes, clothes-horses, or anything of the kind
that will make a good foundation for the article and save
extra work. When you feel that you can construct a piece
of furniture without such helps, do so by all means, but at
first do not scorn the humble box and barrel, they are excellent
things to practise on.</p>

<p class="c009">The dressing-table is made of two pine shelves,
two cigar-boxes, two small brackets, and an ordinary mirror.
For the large shelf choose a board about twelve inches
wide or wider, if you
have one, measure the
space your dressing-table
is to occupy,
mark the size on the
board with a pencil,
using your try-square
to make your line at
right angles with the
edge of your board,
and saw off the board
at the ruled line. If
the room is neither
plastered nor ceiled
and the uprights are
left uncovered, let
the large shelf reach
across from one upright
to the next, and
make the smaller
shelf just long and
wide enough to fit in
between. Saw out
your supporting
braces after the pattern
given in Fig. 11,
with the grain of the
wood running up and down, making six in all; two for the
large shelf, two for the small shelf, and two for the little
side-brackets. Draw a line at each end of your shelf where
<span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span>the brace is to be fastened, and on this line bore two holes
entirely through the board. With screws long enough to
reach through the shelf and into
the braces fasten the shelf and
braces together, Fig. 12. Bore
a hole near the bottom edge of
each brace, as in Fig. 13, and
directly over each brace screw
into the top of the shelf, as near
the edge as possible, a screw-eye,
Fig. 14. Cover both shelves with
pretty cretonne, putting a ruffle
on the large shelf and drawing the material neatly over the
edges of the smaller one.</p>

<p class="c009">On each end of the large shelf tack a cigar-box,
which you have previously painted white.
These boxes are for holding brushes and combs.
Screw strong hooks into the uprights at the proper
distance from the floor, then hook your large shelf
on by the screw-eyes at the top, and screw the
braces to the uprights through the holes at their
lower corners. The upper shelf, not being so
heavy, needs only the hooks and screw-eyes to
support it, and screws at the bottom of the braces are
unnecessary. Hang this only a little way above the other
shelf. Make the small brackets
of thinner wood and let them be
square, of a size to fit the uprights.
One brace for each bracket is all
that is necessary, and the braces
must, of course, be smaller than

the side boxes; enamel paint is the best to use, as it gives a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>hard, smooth surface. Only the hooks and screw-eyes are
required to hold the brackets. Hang the mirror with its
bottom edge resting on the

you must saw off the corners

outer edge of the top shelf
nail securely a strip of wood
three inches wide, having its
top edge on a level with the
top of the shelf, Fig. 17. Into
this strip, as well as into the
top cross-pieces, screw
clothes-hooks, placing them
about eight inches apart.
With short wire-nails, or
screws if you wish your

cross-pieces and the other shelf on the middle cross-pieces
<span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>of the frame. Paint the shelves and the inside of the frame
white, and over the outside tack flowered cretonne or
chintz, remembering to have the right side of the material
turned inward. Fasten a brass or galvanized iron rod to
the top of the two front uprights and from this hang a
curtain of the same material. To fit the holders, or fastenings,
for the curtain rod it will be necessary to cut notches
in the inner corners of the uprights, Fig. 18, otherwise they
will not be at the proper angle to hold the rod. To prevent
dust from settling upon the clothing, tack a three-cornered
piece of cretonne over the top of the frame. The
shoe-box shown in the illustration is not a part of the
clothes press, but is a convenient addition.</p>

the flower-stand use
one fold of the ever-useful
clothes-horse.
Make twelve three-cornered
braces, cutting
<span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>them out like Fig. 22, four measuring seven inches on
their edges, four nine inches, and four twelve inches or as
long as the width of the board will allow. Saw out four
shelves which will reach
exactly across the frame,
two of them nine inches
and two eleven inches
wide. Screw the smaller
braces to the narrow
shelves, the larger ones
to the widest, making
sure the back edges of
shelf and brace are on an
exact line; fitting them
in your try-square will
assure you of that. To
give additional strength
to the frame, measure
the distance from the
bottom edge of the lower
cross-piece, where it joins
the upright, diagonally
across to the other upright
within one inch of
the floor (Fig. 23), then
take two narrow boards,
say three inches wide
and one inch thick, and
saw them the required
length. Lay your frame down flat, place first one diagonal
in position, then the other, and make a pencil line across
the upper and lower corners showing where they must be
taken off in order to fit inside the frame. A mitre-box is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>very useful here, for by its aid you can saw your boards
<span class="fltright kd100"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_019-fig22.jpg" alt="Fig. 22." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 22.</span></span>
at the required angle without difficulty. Lacking that, be
careful to have your edges straight. Place
the diagonals in position in the frame and
mark the width of each on the surface of
the other where they cross. Between these
two lines, on the edges of the boards, draw
a line which will divide the edge exactly in
half. Saw along the oblique lines down to
the line on the edge, then with a chisel pare
down to the edge lines, thus “halving” your boards, Fig. 24.</p>

<p class="c009">Cross your diagonals at the halving
and with long wire nails, driven from
the outside of the frame, nail them in
place, Fig. 25. Now fit the largest
braces on the front and back of each
upright with edges resting on the floor
as in Fig. 26, and screw them on with
screws near the top as shown by C and
D, Fig. 26. Have the outside edges of
the braces on a line with the outside

edges of the uprights; this will leave a
space of about an inch on the inside of
the uprights. The braces will hold the frame in an upright
position, but in order to support
any weight it must be further
strengthened by adding a platform
to which the braces may be screwed.
Make the platform of a size to fit inside
the uprights and reach across
from end to end of the braces. Two
<span class="fltleft kd100"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_020-fig25.jpg" alt="Fig. 25." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 25.</span></span>
or more boards will be required to give sufficient width,
and it will be necessary to stay them by putting on three
<span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span>cleats across the under side, as in Fig. 27. These cleats
must be of equal width and thickness and, as in all cleats,
the grain of the wood must run lengthwise.
Cut notches at each end, as shown
in the diagram, to fit the projecting uprights,
then fit the platform into the
frame, and screw the braces on to its
edges, Fig. 28. You have now a firm
foundation and may add your shelves.
The widest shelves are to go across the
frame on either side on a line with the
top of the lower cross-piece,
the narrower

shelves on a line with the top of the
middle cross-piece. Fasten these in
place with screws at the lower end of
each brace, and with hooks in the uprights,
and screw-eyes at the top of the
shelves, as in the shelves for the dressing-stand,
Fig. 14.</p>

<p class="c009">Instead of four you now have two
very broad shelves, running directly

through the frame. Take measurements
of these shelves and
make a shallow box, about seven
inches deep, to fit each shelf.
To prevent the boxes springing
at the seams from dampness, get
a strip of tin three inches wide,
bend it through the middle
lengthwise, and tack it over the
seams, as in Fig. 29. Paint the entire frame and the outside
and edges of the boxes dark green, and then varnish
<span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>them. Of course the paint must be quite dry before the
varnish is applied.</p>

piece of furniture, for you will want it to be durable. If you
prefer you may make it altogether of new material after
the same pattern, but a box for the foundation will simplify
the work. When standing on end your box should measure
about five feet six inches in height, eighteen inches in
depth, and twenty inches in width. Nail two cleats, each
thirteen inches long, in an upright position on each side
<span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>and at the back of the box, as shown by the letters E, F,
G, H in Fig. 30, placing the front ones, E, one inch back
from the edge as in diagram.
Fig. 30 gives one
side and the back of the
box. Across and resting
on the top of these upright
cleats nail the cleats
I and J. Lay the box on
its side and draw a curve
like Fig. 31, starting the
line four inches from the
top and ending it two
feet from the bottom.
The curve at its greatest
fulness should take in
half the width of the
side. Draw a curve exactly
like the first on the other side of the box; saw carefully
along the lines, following them as closely as possible,
and then take off the remaining rough edges with a chisel.

Nail a strip of wood four inches wide across the front at
the top to finish the hood, Fig. 32. Box in the lower front
up to the top of the cleats and
there make a seat to fit in the
chair and rest on the cleats,
Fig. 32. You will notice that
in the seat, near the forward
corners, are two holes; these
are for the adjustment of the
rest, which gives additional
comfort to the chair, and upon
which one may stretch one’s self
out luxuriantly. Two boards,
three feet four inches long,
will be required for
the rest, which should
be just wide enough
to fit easily inside the
chair, resting on the
seat. Cleat the rest at
each end and in the
middle, as in Fig. 33,
putting the end cleats
on the edges of the
boards and the middle
one underneath.
Round the corners and
smooth them off with
knife or chisel.</p>

Throughout the entire United
States Easter eggs are very popular,
and the practice of coloring them is
increasing rather than diminishing.
The stores are full of all sorts of
novelties in real or simulated eggs;
some valued at very large sums have
been manufactured in London, but
Uncle Sam does not raise such costly
varieties. The real fun is in coloring
one’s own eggs, and if the eggs can
be transformed into something else, the sport will be
doubled. To turn an egg into</p>

of diversion. Cut stiff paper in the shape of Fig. 37. Make a<span class="fltright kd200"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_027-fig37.jpg" alt="Fig. 37." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 37.</span></span>
small hole on one side of an egg (Fig. 38, B) and a tiny hole
at one end (A), remove the contents by shaking the egg and
blowing in at the end A. Then fit the shell on a stand made
of a paper box with a hole cut in it just large enough to hold
the egg firmly, and pour some melted wax in at the hole B,
using great care to keep the egg steady, that the weight
may fall exactly in the centre and make a perfect balance.</p>

<p class="c009">Paste paper over each hole and fit the frog (Fig. 37) on
the egg, keeping the side of the egg with the covered opening
<span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>B for the top, forming the back of the frog. Remove
the paper frog and cover the slashes cut in the back with
melted sealing-wax, while hot
adjust it on the egg, pressing
the slashes against the shell<span class="fltleft kd125"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_027-fig38.jpg" alt="Fig. 38." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 38.</span></span>
before the wax hardens and
holding them in place until
they adhere. When perfectly
dry paint the frog mottled
green on the back and a yellowish
white underneath in
oil colors (Fig. 39). Try to
recall the coloring of a real
frog and make this one as lifelike
as possible. Pour water in a large basin and stir it
around to produce a current. The paint having dried,
place the frog on the top of the water<span class="fltleft kd200"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_027-fig39.jpg" alt="Fig. 39." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 39.</span></span>
and watch it swim. If you would like
to race these queer Easter eggs, make
two or three frogs and start them all
swimming at the same time.</p>

<p class="c009">Should oil paints not be at hand, use
stiff brown paper, preferably glazed,
for Fig. 37. Make a hole at each end
of the egg-shell and remove the contents. Drop some shot
in the shell and glue paper over each opening; then fasten
the paper frog, with the hole
in its back (Fig. 37), securely
on the egg. Wait until it is
perfectly dry before placing
the little animal on the water,
where it will look very comical
and lifelike, even though
it is not green in color.</p>

says the old legend, and if you would prove it, arise early
and watch the reflection of the sun as it plays hide-and-seek
on the surface of the clear water which you have
placed in a tin basin where it can catch the first rays from
the “King of Day.” A breath of air will cause the water
to move, and with the motion comes the dance, as the sun
sparkles and glides here and there, glittering and laughing
in its joyous play. The legend is a pretty one and its
meaning deeper than appears on the surface.</p>

<p class="c009">Beside enabling one to see the sun dance, being up early
gives time, before breakfast, to help decorate the table as
a pleasant surprise to the family. One of the most attractive
ornaments is the white dove
with its snowy wings spread wide,
while it floats and sways in mid-air
as if it were really flying slowly
and softly through the room. It is easily made. Take a
pure white egg, and empty the contents; then cut from
writing paper the wing (Fig. 40), head (Fig. 41), and tail
(Fig. 42). Pin each in turn on a fresh, smooth piece of
cotton wadding and cut the raw cotton out along the lines
of the pattern. Make two wings of the cotton wadding,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>and cut two wing-bones (Fig. 43) from stiff paper; open
each cotton wing along the upper edge about a quarter of
an inch in depth, according to dotted line O O (Fig. 40),
insert a paper bone in each opening and gum it sparingly
here and there. Smooth up the edges of the cotton wings,
covering the bones entirely; then gum the wings to the
sides of the egg according to the dotted line on one end.
Fasten the tail in place and, last of all, the head; open the
neck a little and paste each side of the open edge on the
egg. Bend the wings out, as if the bird were flying.</p>

tight on the back of the dove, something as a leather sucker
is stuck on a brick; it will soon dry. In the morning suspend
the dove over the centre of the table (Fig. 44) by
tying the end of the thread on the chandelier. Let it be
about ten inches above the dishes. If you can handle pen
and ink very lightly, the bird’s eyes and mouth may be
carefully marked, although this is not absolutely necessary,

    <div><b>Easter Hare</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c018">Why this little animal is associated with Easter eggs no
one seems to be able to tell. There are several legends
which explain the connection, each one different from the
others. This is the prettiest:</p>

<p class="c009">"Scarcely had the Winter King left on his way to Northland
when the young Prince, Spring, passed along, bringing
with him delicate flowers and wild birds. The flowers
charmed his senses with their exquisite perfume, and the
birds entertained and delighted him with their sweet songs;
but Spring was lonely and sighed for the children of the
earth, for whom he had brought these fair gifts. Thinking,
perchance, they did not know of his coming, he concluded
to send them tidings, when suddenly a little hare appeared,
and immediately the Prince decided that the swift-footed
animal should be his messenger. The little hare, however,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>begged hard to be spared, as he stood in terror of the dreadful
shot-gun, which had killed so many of his brothers. But
Spring, smiling said: ‘You shall be the bearer of gifts to the
people, then they will not harm you,’ and the hare, calmed
but hardly convinced, consented to do the will of the Prince.</p>

<p class="c009">"Then Spring wove a dainty willow-basket and filled it
with pretty colored eggs, which the birds gave him, and this
he handed to the hare to give to the people, with many sweet
messages from Spring.</p>

<p class="c009">“Taking the basket in his mouth, the hare trotted off
rapidly toward the nearest village. When he reached
there, however, fearing the grown people, he delivered
the messages to the children and gave them all the pretty
eggs.”</p>

<p class="c009">A delightful little legend, isn’t it? And Spring must
have been well pleased with the hare for choosing to deliver
his messages to the children, for on this day it is the young
people who first know of the coming of Spring.</p>

    <div><b>Hares Made of Eggs</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c018">The Easter hares shown in Fig. 53 are made of eggs.
Goose eggs are the best to use—they are so much larger
than hen’s eggs.</p>

<p class="c009">Blow the egg if you desire to keep the little hare; if
you wish later to eat it, boil the egg hard.</p>

<p class="c009">Take two little tufts of cotton, roll and pinch them in
shape for the ears, then two more tufts for the forefeet;
fasten ears and feet to the shell with gum arabic, in the
position shown in Fig. 53. Remember, the small end of the
egg is the hare’s head; on this end, below the ears, draw
with pen and ink the eyes, nose and mouth, using Fig. 53 as
a guide.</p>

the back until that side of the paper is covered with lead,
taking care not to tear it in doing so. Place the face on the
shell, the printed side out, and holding it steady, go over
<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>the lines with a pencil. This will reproduce the face on
the shell, then with pen and black ink strengthen the drawing.
The small end of the shell is the head and the

Even play eggs manufactured of paper have
many possibilities. Of course, all girls
would rather make these for themselves
than to buy them, be the trifles ever so
beautiful; for, after all, the purchased
eggs can only be looked at and then put
away. You cannot have any real sport
with them; cannot take them apart and
put them together again any more than “all the king’s
horses and all the king’s men” could restore “Humpty
Dumpty” after his fall; nor can you change these designs
from one thing to another, each complete in itself. Only
the home-made Easter egg admits of such manipulation. It
is an Enchanted Egg and from it can be made</p>

the top egg and draw a straight line from pin-point to pin-point
of the upper and then of the lower slit; these lines
<span class="pageno" id="Page_46">46</span>are guides and render it easy to cut the slits to correspond
with those in the first egg. The two eggs must be exactly
alike, as they are in reality the two sides of one egg. Trace
the markings of Fig. 82 on one egg and spread strong paste
sparingly over the darkened portion, not allowing it to
extend in the least across the boundary lines, for the white
spaces must be left free, that they may form openings or
pockets. Again fit the two sides together (the paste will
cause them to adhere), and place the egg under a few books,
or some other weight, to dry, and in a little while it will be
ready for transformation.</p>

<p class="c018">Make the head like Fig. 99. A is the portion which
must be placed in the small end of the egg, A, Fig. 82, allowing
the lower curve of the head, K, to extend down
over the egg. Cut from
very stiff writing-paper a
like curve, and paste it in
position on the other side of
the head, where it should
hang free: only the top
edge of the piece being
fastened on the head in
order that the curve may
easily slip down over the
other side of the egg. This will make both sides of the
bird appear alike. Fold a piece of writing-paper, and from
it cut Fig. 100; the straight fold extends from O to U.
Carefully fasten together the open edges of the back from
T to O and from U to P; gluing them on the extreme
edges, that the pocket thus formed may be as large as
possible. Take stiff paper for Figs. 101 and 102, which
are the feet and tail of the bird, the extension X of Fig. 102
forming the tail. Leave the eyes and mouth white, and
paint the remainder of the head black; also blacken the
wings and back, Fig. 100, and the feet and tail. Place the
head in the small end of the egg, A, with the curves K
down over the white egg on each side; then put on the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>little fellow’s overcoat, or back, Fig. 100, fitting it over the
sides, F, Fig. 81, of the egg; push the egg or body of the
penguin in the pocket formed in the back of the overcoat,
and shove the feet into the large end of the egg, D, Fig. 82.
Hold the lower edges of the egg firmly together while you
bend out the feet sufficiently to enable the penguin to stand
alone, Fig. 103.</p>

<p class="c009">These little creatures should be made so carefully that
either side will be presentable. It is always distressing to
know that “the other side” does not look real, and it is a
great satisfaction to be able to show both sides of our work
to our friends and know there is no “wrong side” in what
we do. If you can manage to paint the designs in water-colors
they will look best, but even when marked with
black ink the little animals are charming; no adequate idea
can be gained of this fascinating Easter egg until all the
different parts have been made and the egg changed from
one to another of the various life-like little creatures.
The egg has been so planned that the wings come down
and cover the tops of the legs of both rooster and ostrich;
the penguin and rabbit need no such cover, as the rabbit’s
legs fit in naturally, and those of the penguin merely
slide up in the egg. A little practice will enable you to
perform the work skilfully.</p>

<p class="c009">Butterflies are also emblems used for Easter. The beautiful
fairy-like creature changing in its close, gloomy chrysalis
from an insignificant little worm to the radiant winged
creature of the air, fitly typifies the Resurrection. Did you
ever find a chrysalis and after examining it lay it carefully
aside, to await the development of the life within, and some
bright morning discover the shell broken and empty, while
in the room fluttered a brightly colored butterfly? If so,
you will enjoy all the more</p>

<p>Fig. 104.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c009">Take four pieces of tissue-paper—yellow, red, blue, and
white—and cut each according to Fig. 104. The shape is
not exactly that of a real butterfly,
but when made of paper it proves
more satisfactory, because such butterflies
fly far better when cut in
this way. Fasten a fine black thread
through the back of each butterfly
(Fig. 105); bend the wings up a little
and tie, or fasten with bits of court-plaster,
the loose ends of the threads on a round stick, placing
them at a distance of about four inches apart. Let the
threads vary in length from six to thirteen inches; this will
bring the butterflies at different distances from the stick.
When all is
ready stand
about forty-five
inches from
and in direct
line with a register
built in the
side wall next
to the floor;
<span class="fltright kd350"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_051-fig105.jpg" alt="Fig. 105." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 105.</span></span>
hold the stick, with the butterflies attached, up and out horizontally
fifty or more inches from the floor. The gentle
heat will cause the brilliant little things to flutter up and
down, this way and that, in a most natural manner; the fine
black threads being practically invisible, the butterflies
appear as if floating in the air without aid from any
source.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>You might try the experiment of taking them out-of-doors;
if the breeze is not too strong, the butterflies will
behave in the most approved manner, which you know all
about, having so often watched the graceful movements of
the beautiful live insects during the long summer days.</p>

<p class="c009">Perhaps the most charming of all Easter offerings is</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
<div class="nf-center c017">
    <div><b>The Easter Lily</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c018">Everyone strives to have a lily on Easter day. If you
are unable to obtain one of the beautiful, fresh flowers, do
the next best thing; make a lily—a stately,
graceful white blossom on a long,
dark-green stalk.
The flower is
lovely even when manufactured of tissue-paper, and can be made
to look so natural that one almost
expects to find the sweet, delicate
perfume of the real blossom. The
paper plant has one advantage at
least over the natural one: it lasts much
longer and needs no care to keep it fresh.
From a new, smooth sheet of white tissue-paper
cut six petals (Fig. 106); fold
each lengthwise through its centre and
bend or curl the top into a slight curve
to take away the stiffness (Fig. 107); then
cut Fig. 108 of unruled white writing-paper.
Paint both sides of the stigma
or top a greenish yellow and the style or
stem-like portion a pale Nile-green. Bend
the style up flat against the scalloped stigma according to
the dotted line in Fig. 108. Allow an eighth of an inch and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>bend the style back again, which will make a little tuck in
the style, bringing it exactly in the centre of the scalloped
stigma when it is straightened out (Fig. 109).
Fold each of the three scallops of the stigma
through its centre and bend them down (Fig.
109); this finishes the pistil.</p>

in the same way as you did the style of the pistil,
and slightly curve the orange-colored anthers.
These should seemingly balance directly on the
tip-top of the supports (Fig. 111). With strong
paste fasten the pistils and stamens
on the end of a stick which
has previously been covered
with dark olive-green tissue-paper
(Fig. 112); then paste on
three of the white petals (Fig. 113).
Use paste sparingly, and be careful to
arrange the petals evenly before adding the remaining
three (Fig. 114), which should be placed
one over each space between the first three petals.
Fig. 115 will make the idea plainer. The
petals numbered 1, 2, 3 represent the first three;
the other three alternate with these, coming back
of and between them as in the corolla (Fig. 115). Should the
last petals incline to droop, attach them to the inner ones
about midway up with a very little paste.</p>

Here is a piece of advice for you, girls; possibly
it may not be appreciated, but it is good advice,
nevertheless: While you are away for
your summer holidays, keep out of sight the
fancy work you do at home.</p>

<p class="c009">When we drop the work or study that
has employed us during the long winter and
spring months and go off in the summer to
be refreshed and invigorated, do we not say
we go for recreation? If you will stop to
think about it you will see that recreation means literally
re-creating, being created anew; it means the laying
aside of our ordinary habits and thoughts and adopting
entire new ones, for the time being at least. It is this
refreshing change of thought and occupation as well as
change of air that proves so beneficial; therefore, don’t
keep the one little portion of your brain which you devote
to fancy work busy all summer long in the old routine, but
let it have recreation as well as the rest of your mind and
body.</p>

<p class="c009">By this I do not mean that the faculty ordinarily exercised
in the interest of fancy work should not be used in
any way, or that the hands which take so kindly to
needle and thread should be always idle. Not at all; but
<span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>there are other forms of work for quiet hours, distinctively
summer work, which with their entire or comparative
novelty refresh the mind and give added deftness to the
hands.</p>

<p>Cone Hanging-basket.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c009">The rainy day comes occasionally and you cannot be
out of doors; then is the time to look over the store of
treasures which you have gathered in your walks through
wood and field and try to devise some
means of preserving them or making them
of use. To begin with, there are your pine
cones, and no doubt you have gathered a
great number of them; everyone does.
Sort the cones and select several of the
largest, most open ones to use as hanging-baskets
in your window next winter, and
if you have an open fire devote the remaining
cones to creating a cheery blaze,
to help disperse the gloom that a northeast
storm in summer is apt to throw over one.</p>

<p class="c009">If you are impatient to try the experiment
of making a</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
<div class="nf-center c017">
    <div><b>Cone Hanging-basket,</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c020">you need not wait until winter, for, being
in the country, your materials are all close
at hand, and there is no reason why you
should not start one immediately. Having
selected your cone, shake out the seeds, if any remain in
it, and tie a cord around at about the middle, leaving a
loop on the top by which to hang it, as in the illustration.
Fill the interstices with lightly sifted earth, scatter a handful
of wheat or oats over it, and thoroughly dampen the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_59">59</span>whole. Hang the cone in your window, keep it damp, and
shortly the grain will sprout and the cone will become a
mass of vivid green.</p>

<p class="c009">Of course the beauty of the cone hanging-basket does
not last a great while, but a new one can be so quickly and
easily prepared that, with a store of half a dozen cones, you
may have one fresh and green in your window all winter.
Almost any kind of small cereal will sprout if treated in
this way, and each time you can plant different
seeds.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
<div class="nf-center c017">
    <div><b>Sweet-grass Mats</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c020">to put in the linen closet or bureau-drawers.
These mats, placed between sheets or clothing,
impart such a sweet, country perfume
you will be surprised and delighted with the
result. Take seven or eight stalks of the
sweet grass, cut off the flower-heads, bunch
the stalks together, and with a long,
strong blade of the grass, wrap tightly
into a rope, as in Fig. 121. Make
several of these ropes before beginning
your mat. Then coil one in an
oblong, and sew it together, as shown
in the diagram, Fig. 122.
<span class="fltright kd225"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_059-fig122.jpg" alt="Fig. 122." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 122.</span></span>
When the first rope is nearly
used up, wrap the free end
securely to the end of another
rope and continue to coil as
before. When finished, the longest diameter of the mat
should measure about seven inches. You will notice in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_60">60</span><span class="fltleft kd225"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_060-fig123.jpg" alt="Fig. 123." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 123.</span></span>

sweet-grass mat completed,

<p class="c009">With all the other treasures,
I hardly think it has occurred
to you to collect corn-husks,
and yet many pretty things can be made of them. For
instance, there is the</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
<div class="nf-center c017">
    <div><b>Corn-husk Basket,</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c020">strong, durable, and useful. For making one of these
baskets select the fine, inner husks, and wrap them in a
<span class="fltleft kd150"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_060-fig124.jpg" alt="Fig. 124." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 124.</span></span>
damp cloth, let them remain two hours, and then
cut into strips about one inch wide. Take six of
these strips and tie them together at one end with
a strong thread; separate the strips
into three strands, two strips to a
<span class="fltright kd150"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_060-fig125.jpg" alt="Fig. 125." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 125.</span></span>
strand, and braid as in Fig. 124.
In the beginning do not choose
strips all of the same length,
as they will have to be pieced
out to make the braid the required
length, and the piecing
should not be all done at
the same place. When you
have nearly reached the end
of your shortest strip, open it out flat, lay the end of a new
strip over it as in Fig. 125, and fold together as in Fig. 126.
In this way the piecing goes on as the braid grows in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_61">61</span>length. When you have about a yard of the braid, dampen
and begin to coil it as in Fig. 127, fastening the edges together
with needle and strong, waxed thread. It will require
the whole yard of braid for the bottom of the basket,
which should measure about five inches in diameter. Before
you have coiled quite all of it, piece the strips again
and make a yard or so more of braid. Dampen the new
part and begin to coil once more, this time turning the
braid up on its edge, and running it around horizontally to
form the sides of the basket, widening the sides a little with
each row. Four inches is a good depth for a basket of this
kind. Finish the top of the basket by sewing another row
of braid around the outer edge. For the handle make a
braid twelve inches long, then divide the strands and at
the end of the large braid make two small ones six inches
long. Fasten the ends of the small braids and cut off neatly
close to the wrapping. Remove the thread which holds
the other end of the large braid together and separate the
strips far enough up to make two small braids at that end
the length of those you have just finished. Sew the handle
on the outside of the basket in the position shown in the
illustration, tucking the ends between the bottom and next
<span class="pageno" id="Page_62">62</span>to the bottom row of braids, and fastening them neatly on
the inside.</p>

you have them, extra lavender blossoms. Pin one
end of your ribbon at the top
of the bulb, where the stalks
are tied together, pushing the
pin through the ribbon down into
the bulb, then begin to weave
it under and over the stalks as in Fig. 129. Weave about
two inches, widening all the time, then draw the ribbon a
little tighter, bring the stalks closer together, and narrow
the bulb gradually. When the stalks are bunched again,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_64">64</span>stop weaving and begin to wrap,
lapping the edges of the ribbon
as in the illustration. Have the
wrapping tight and firm and,
when about an inch or two from
the ends of the stalks, fasten
with needle and thread, then
tie the ribbon in a bow of
many loops. Finish the top
with a bow also, making it
quite full.</p>

    <div><b>Braiding Palm-grasses and Corn-husks</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c018">Away down in Florida, where
the palms and palmettos are
as common as are the most ordinary
trees and shrubs in the
North, most of the children
wear hats made of the strong
and durable leaves of these
beautiful trees; and all the
children know how to braid
the palm in a number of ways.
Indeed, it was a little girl not more than eight
years old who taught me just what I am going to try to
teach you. She was “keeping house” with a number of
other children on one of the fine, shady streets of Daytona,
Fla., and, stopping to watch them at their play, we were
made welcome in their “house,” and one little hostess gave
me the lesson I asked for then and there.</p>

<p class="c009">You all know how a palm-leaf grows, tall and straight,
and closed tightly like a fan until it is time for it to open,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_65">65</span><span class="fltleft kd75"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_065-fig130.jpg" alt="Fig. 130." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 130.</span></span>
when it slowly separates and spreads its fingers
wide. It was the unopened leaf of the cabbage-palm
which was chosen for the braid, and very
pretty the tender leaf is; white, soft, and pliable,
and edged with light green. It is beautifully
adapted to braiding, and the fingers of my
little teacher flew deftly, as the braid lengthened
in her hands, and my mind sped along
almost as swiftly, as I tried to adapt the process
to materials to be found in the North, so
that Northern, as well as Southern, girls might share with
me this little piece of handicraft.</p>

<p class="c009">I am sure wide, flat grasses can be braided in this way,
and corn-husks and—well, a number of other things which
you will find if you keep your
eyes open; but I must return to
the palm and tell you just how
I was taught to braid that.</p>

</div>

<p class="c009">First I tore the leaf into strips about one-quarter of
an inch wide, then taking two strips, I folded one
end of each as in Fig. 130, and lapped the folded ends
as in Fig. 131. Bending the right-hand strip (A),
I pushed it through the loop formed by the other (B)
as in Fig. 132, and pulled B down tightly (Fig. 133).
Bending B, I pushed that through the loop A had formed,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_66">66</span>and drawing A tightly, left a loop of B at the top (Fig.
134). Each time a loop was formed I pushed another loop
through it and drew the first down snugly,
and so braided a strip like Fig. 135.</p>

<p class="c009">My little teacher forgot to show me
how to piece the strips,
and I was obliged to
work out the problem
for myself and for you.
When one of the strips
had dwindled down and
grown too narrow, I cut it off, leaving
a little
over an inch
below the
loop. I then
inserted another strip over B,
pushing it under A, as in Fig.
136, bringing it over the B loop
and again under A on the other
side, pulling it down until the two short ends were even.
After that I continued to braid as before, the first two B
loops being double, of course.</p>

<p class="c009">It is not well to have the piecing of both strips come
together, therefore one should be longer than the other at
the start, and the strips should be always of the same width
in order to make the braid uniform and even.</p>

<p class="c009">This is regular hat braid you have learned to make, and
perhaps having done so much you will feel inspired to continue
the work and make a hat, if not a large one, at least
one for your own or your younger sister’s doll. Or you
can make it into a basket by sewing the braid together, lapping
one edge over the other.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_67">67</span>The braid should be back-stitched for both hats and
baskets.</p>

<p class="c009">Most materials require damping before they are braided,
for even when soft and pliable they are apt to separate
when dry, unless they have first been soaked for a while in
water.</p>

Every girl can have her own
gallery of famous artists’ pictures,
and the searching for and finding
of treasures to form a home art
collection are a constant source
of interest. When once the supply
is started it grows rapidly, for the fascination increases
as the work progresses, and the nucleus of a fine assortment
is soon gathered. Daily papers furnish valuable material
in this line through their reproductions of paintings, and
the market is flooded with beautifully illustrated magazines
giving the art of our own land and that of foreign countries;
then there are unmounted photographs of masterpieces
which may be purchased for a very small sum; many can
be bought at a penny each.</p>

<p class="c009">If new magazines are not to be had, old ones can be
found at bookstalls for low prices, which contain reproductions
of paintings and excellent accounts of them. Carefully
take the magazines apart, removing the wire fastenings
by straightening and drawing them out before attempting
to separate the leaves; then cut out the chosen pictures,
allowing as wide a white margin as possible. Only those
prints which represent the work of eminent artists should
be selected.</p>

<p class="c009"><span class="pageno" id="Page_70">70</span>Decide upon some definite line of art, for the field is
a large and varied one. Better results can be obtained if
you devote your efforts to the paintings of only one nation,
such as American, English, French, or Flemish art. Again,
the collection might embrace the works of but one artist or
school of painting, or be restricted to famous caricaturists
or mural decorators. Having made your choice and collected
two or three designs, buy low-priced medium-weight

<p class="c018">Select a kind not brittle or liable to tear; get either a soft
gray tone or white, the former often harmonizing best with
black and white pictures. Your material being ready, turn
the pictures on the wrong side and mark the
centres. The easiest way of doing this is by
laying a ruler diagonally across the back of
picture, Fig. 137, and drawing a line on the
<span class="fltright kd75"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_070-fig138.jpg" alt="Fig. 138." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 138.</span></span>
paper along the edge of the ruler. Be sure to
have the ruler precisely at the corners; if
placed either to one side or the other, the centre
will not be found. Fig. 138 shows the first line
drawn; cross this line by another running from
the remaining two corners which will give Fig.
139; the point where the lines intersect is the
exact centre of the picture. Cut the
mounting board in portions large enough to
allow a surrounding margin of four or five inches
<span class="fltleft kd75"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_070-fig139.jpg" alt="Fig. 139." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 139.</span></span>
on each picture; then mark the centres on the
right, not wrong, side of the mounting board.
It will be unnecessary to extend the line from
corner to corner of the mounting board; lay the ruler across
and mark it merely at the centre, Fig. 140. Take the print
<span class="pageno" id="Page_71">71</span><span class="fltright kd125"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_071-fig140.jpg" alt="Fig. 140." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 140.</span></span>
you intend to mount first and carefully place it upon the
blank piece of paper so that the centre of the picture will
be exactly over the centre of the blank
paper; lightly mark a line in lead-pencil
around two corners of the picture, remove
the print and the blank paper resembles
Fig. 141. The last markings
are a guide in pasting the picture on
the sheet of paper. First dampen the
wrong side of the print with a wet
sponge. Have ready some strong paste
and spread it lightly on the wrong side.
Be careful not to get too much paste
lest it smear the mounting-paper. Lay
<span class="fltleft kd125"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_071-fig141.jpg" alt="Fig. 141." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 141.</span></span>
the mounting-sheet upon a perfectly
clean, level surface and place the print
on it according to the guiding marks.
Have the picture absolutely smooth,
without a suspicion of a wrinkle or
blister, and with a clean cloth again
smooth it gently, pressing it down here<span class="fltright kd125"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_071-fig142.jpg" alt="Fig. 142." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 142.</span></span>
and there as seems necessary to make it
adhere firmly (Fig. 142). Then place
a weight upon the mounted picture
and leave it to dry. After having
been successful with one picture no
difficulty will be found in mounting
the others.</p>

<p class="c009">It often happens that it is impossible
to separate a picture from the
article treating of it, for the reason
that one side of the page gives the print and the other
side the description. This difficulty is remedied by</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c020">which will give two layers of uniform thickness, and if
there are pictures on each side of the paper they may both
be preserved. Cut two pieces of perfectly smooth muslin
a little larger all around than the sheet of paper to be split.
Dampen one of the pieces of muslin and lay it out smooth
on an even, flat surface; cover one side of the paper to be
split with a thin layer of very strong paste or glue and
carefully place the paper, paste-side down, on the muslin;
lay it out flat and be sure it does not wrinkle; then cover
the other side of the paper with paste and place the
second dampened piece of muslin over it. Be certain that
the muslin adheres over the entire surface of both sides
of the paper. Should it fail in places, the spots of paper
not clinging to the muslin will tear out during the splitting.
See that the paste extends to the outermost edges of
the paper, and do not forget that muslin, paper, and paste
must all be smooth. Use a rolling-pin to secure uniform
adhesion. When the pasting is done, let it dry, and after
it has dried perfectly, separate the two pieces of muslin at
one corner, and the paper will begin to split if the work
has been properly done. Continue opening the edges until
all four sides are partially separated, and the fission of the
paper just beginning; then a firm pull will entirely separate
the two pieces of muslin and, at the same time, split
the paper. If you experiment on a small piece of paper
before attempting the picture you will better understand
the process. To remove the muslin from the paper, soak it
in hot water; place the water in a basin large enough to
admit of the muslin lying out flat. Let the paper side be
underneath, so that the muslin may be easily removed
when it detaches itself from the paper. Should any bits of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_73">73</span>paste remain on the paper, soak them off; move the paper
gently in the water back and forward, until the paste is
washed away; then lift the paper from the water by placing
a thin stick of wood under one edge and carefully
drawing the wet picture out; it will hang like a curtain
from the stick. Let the water drip off; then lay the
paper down flat and smooth on a piece of blotting-paper,
picture-side up. When nearly dry, place the picture
between two sheets of pasteboard, and leave it under
a weight until quite dry. Mount split pictures on white
card-board; gray will show through the thin paper.
On the back of each mounting-board fasten two small
brass rings by which</p>

<p class="c018">Slide a ring on a short piece of tape and glue the ends
of the tape at one side on the back and near the top of the
picture to form a hook (Fig. 143, H).
Do the same with a second ring and
tape. When both tapes are securely
fastened on the mounting-board, paste
over each a strip of tough paper or
muslin (Fig. 143, P). If a wire be
fastened on the rings, the pictures
may hang from the picture-moulding
around the room, or the collection
can depend upon nails for support.
If desirable, the rings may fit over
tacks driven in the wall.</p>

on which to hang them. Make the portfolio of two
strong, stiff pieces of pasteboard, cut large enough to extend
one inch beyond each of the four sides of the mounted designs
so as to preclude all possibility of damage to the edges
of the work. Sew a length of brown tape at each corner of
the two sides of the portfolio, making in all eight pieces of
tape, four on each pasteboard; then lay each cover down
on a piece of denim and mark four spots on the cloth, corresponding
to the places where the tapes are fastened on
the pasteboard.</p>

<p class="c009">Remove the denim and punch holes through the cloth at
the four places designated on each piece; button-hole
stitch the openings, and run the tapes through, drawing
the cloth down tight and flat upon the pasteboard; smooth
the brown covering out evenly and turn the four sides
neatly over the edges where they can be securely fastened
by long stitches of strong thread taken from edge to edge
of the cloth. Cover the wrong side of each piece with
heavy, rough, brown paper; paste it on carefully and put
them under weights to dry; the paper forms the inside and
the cloth the outside of the portfolio. In such covers any
number of mounted pictures can be kept secure from harm.</p>

<p class="c009">It is only necessary to pile them up evenly on one cover,
lay the other cover on top, and tie the two together over the
pictures by means of the tapes at the four corners. The
portfolio is not intended to stand on edge; it must be laid flat.</p>

<p class="c018">The book may be one of the usual styles of diaries sold
in the stores, or an ordinary blank-book; better still, a
home-made book. The latter requires forty-six sheets of
writing-paper (Fig. 145), and for a
cover stiff brown paper or card-board—the
kind used for making
passe-partouts and which comes in
all colors—will be excellent. Cut
the cover a trifle longer and broader
than the writing-paper, so that it
may extend beyond the leaves of the
book on the sides, protecting the
edges (Fig. 146). Fasten all together
by means of a strong brown or yellow
cord laced through holes made
in the cover and book (Fig. 147).

Should you be unable to cut the holes as neatly as you desire,

ruler in marking the
rays. Draw the top

firmly with the left hand, while
you again place the pencil
down below the circle and
draw the lower ray. Make
the two horizontal rays in the
same way (Fig. 148). After
this it will be easy to draw
the remaining rays by laying
the ruler diagonally between
the top and bottom and the
side rays. Beneath the sun
mark the title in plain lettering

Make yours of twelve pieces of

Decide upon twelve persons whom
you would like to think of often and

paper and that it be returned to you. Having received all
the slips, paste one near the top of each sheet of writing-paper
(Fig. 157); below
paste one leaf of a printed
calendar representing one
month (Fig. 158). Use a
Christmas card for an outside
cover and through the
two top corners of the calendar
make round holes
large enough to allow a
silken cord, matching in
color the tint of the paper,
to pass through. Then
fasten all the pieces of the calendar together in order,
January being the first and December the last (Fig. 159).
<span class="pageno" id="Page_82">82</span>As each month passes by slide that leaf back on the cords,
bringing after January, for instance, February to view.
Hold the two loops of cord together at the top and hang
the calendar where it may be readily seen.</p>

<p class="c018">Do not be surprised! No knowledge of drawing and painting
is necessary in order to illustrate in the new, easy
fashion. Decide upon some short story you wish to
embellish; then look among your scraps for appropriate
pictures. Should you not find exactly what you want,
make the pictures over to suit.</p>

<p class="c009">If the story introduces a jolly little maiden full of fun,
and describes her as feeding her pet dog and laughing at
his antics, and there is no such maiden in your collections,
look for one with the style of face you think the girl in the
story ought to have. When this is found and the body
is not satisfactory, cut off the head and hunt up an appropriate
body to fit it; that obtained, paste the pretty head
on the new body and cut out the entire figure. Find
a dog, in the correct position, in some old magazine or
newspaper, cut out the animal, and before pasting the
group in place try the effect of both on a blank piece
of white paper. Slide the figures together and apart
until you have them where they look best; then paste
the girl and dog neatly in position on the white paper,
and the full-page illustration is ready for insertion in the
book.</p>

<p>Fig. 160.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c009">Always leave a wide white margin on all illustrations;
never crowd the picture up to the very edge of the page if
you desire it to look well, and be sure to dampen the wrong
side of each picture before attempting to paste it in your
<span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>book, that it may be smooth and not wrinkle. The new
leaf for the picture should be cut wide enough to allow a
quarter-inch projection or more over on the opposite page,
as in Fig. 160, OO, where
it can be pasted down on
the inner margin of the
other leaf. The dotted
line indicates the centre
of the book.</p>

<p class="c009">Bound books will not
admit of many extra
leaves being inserted, so
you can select only a few
of the incidents in the
narrative for illustration.
Use care that the picture
shall express your idea of the event or place you desire to
represent. Sometimes it may happen, by lack of suitable
material, that you cannot finish certain pictures for days or
weeks after they are begun. In such a case bide your time
until the wished-for designs appear, and in the meantime
go on with the other illustrations.</p>

<p class="c009">If the book is paper-covered, you can take it all apart,
insert as many pictures as you desire and fasten it together
again. When obtainable use</p>

<p class="c020">as illustrations. You may chance to find appropriate
colored reproductions from water-color sketches, that will
serve the purpose without alteration. Such would give a
fine appearance to your book. Unmounted photographs
can also be employed, but, if possible, avoid different styles
of pictures in the same work. Keep the colored designs
<span class="pageno" id="Page_84">84</span>for one book, the prints for another, and the photographs
for a third. Bear in mind that, whatever the nature of the
illustrations, you are to use only such as appeal to you and
express your ideas; the scheme will lose individuality—that
is, it will not represent your choice—if you select what
others may deem best in preference to that which you
would have chosen if left unmolested. It is the individuality
which gives value to the work.</p>

<p class="c009">Never attempt to illustrate a valuable book in this new
way, though it would not injure the volume if you found a
good unmounted picture of the author and pasted it on one
of the fly-leaves in the front of the book. The portrait
would add to the value and interest of the volume, as
would also items of information on the subject of which
the book treats, if pasted on an extra loose leaf and left in
the back of the book.</p>

linen in color,
make each
leaf 6¾ inches
wide and 5½

Two of the
leaves serve as lining for the cover, leaving fourteen leaves
or twenty-eight pages for the unmounted photographs.

fit over the turned-in border of linen and extend across the
centre onto the edge of the other card-board, LL to KK,

the ¾ of an inch extension with paste, then lap it over on
the left-hand side of the centre and paste securely. The
place where the side of the leaf should be fastened down to
the lining of the cover is represented by MM in Fig. 162.
Fig. 163 shows the space MM covered by the side of the
leaf, the diagram giving two leaves properly glued together,

inch. When the last leaf is fastened
in place, paste it down tight on the
right-hand side of the inside of the
cover, where it will form a lining concealing
the raw edges of the linen and
the blank pasteboard as the first leaf
covered the left-hand side of the inside
of the cover. This system of fastening
the leaves together will cause
them to fold in the back where there will be no raw edges.
Fig. 164 gives four leaves, showing the back where they are
folded over after each is joined to the preceding leaf. When
the book is finished the back hinge part of the cover is free
from the leaves, leaving an opening from top to bottom
large enough to run a slender pencil through when the
book is opened. If desired the cover can be decorated
with the title “Snap-Shots.”</p>

Always alert, chubby little Cupid works
hard on St. Valentine’s Day; his duties
are many, and his pretty bow sends the
arrows flying in all directions. He is a
merry little fellow, full of queer pranks
and a great favorite. The venerable
St. Valentine seems to have merely
loaned his name to the fourteenth of
February, leaving all the duties to Cupid, who appears to
be well pleased with the arrangement. For hundreds of
years past the young people have been as anxious to send
and receive valentines as at the present time</p>

    <div><b>In Former Days,</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c020">before valentines were dropped in the mail-box, girls and
boys had a great deal of fun sending them to each other.
Generally the young folks waited until twilight; then each
would sally forth in his neighborhood, lightly step up to
the front door of the house where the valentine was to be
left, and without the least noise slip the paper under the
door, ring the bell and scamper away as fast as possible, to
avoid being seen. Valentines to-day bring the same thrill
of pleasure, and when the whistle of the postman announces
the arrival of the mail on the eventful day, eager fingers
are impatient to open the envelope and discover the treasure
<span class="pageno" id="Page_90">90</span>within. Then the question follows, “Who could have
sent such a lovely valentine to me?”</p>

<p class="c009">Before making original valentines try to think of some
particular study or pursuit in which each friend is interested
to whom you desire to send a token on February 14. One
may have a talent for painting, another for music; a third
may delight in flowers, and so on throughout a long list of
subjects which will furnish you with many suggestions for</p>

ideas entirely your own, try making the valentines here
described. The mystic four-leaved clover (Fig. 165) would
be just the thing for a companion who delights in hunting
that symbol of good luck. This valentine is very simple
and can be made in
a short time.</p>

clover which has been pressed, use
it instead of the painted one, and
take a whole sheet of paper so that

Do you know that with the aid
of a little enchantment equal to
magic employed by the fairy
folks of old, you can make a tiny
fowl, one small enough to stand

turkey of which anyone might
well be proud.</p>

<p class="c001">The wands you will use for the work differ in nature
and appearance and are far superior to the fairy wands; the
latter are merely stiff sticks said to be endowed with magical
powers, while yours are of most wonderful workmanship
and adapted to any use to which you care to put them.
More than that, you have complete control over the wands;
at your command they do your bidding, making all kinds of
useful and beautiful things, from the most delicate and
fragile articles to the largest and heaviest creations. One
of your wands is known as the right, the other as the left

<p class="c024">Select a small potato (Fig. 192), break off the ends of
three burnt matches and force the longer portions into the
potato, two to serve
as legs, and one as a
support (Fig. 193 ).
Trace Fig. 194  on
stiff brown pasteboard,
an old box-lid
will be the best thing to use, its surface
being dull and almost the same in color
as the potato. Cut out the tracing and mark eyes, mouth,
and tuft on it with ink (Fig. 195 ). If you wish to have your
turkey look extra fine, make wattles
of red paper or cloth (Fig. 196 ); fold
as in Fig. 197 , and paste the band-like
upper portion over each side of the
turkey’s neck, allowing the lower
flaps to hang free (Fig. 198 ). Cut a
slit in the potato (Fig. 192, A-A) and
insert the head, pushing in the extension
as far as the dotted line, or until
it fits (Fig. 199). Make a small opening
on each side of the turkey (Fig. 199, C) and
stick in two curved feathers for wings. If
you have only stiff feathers,
choose two small ones, and
with your forefinger and thumb
bend the ribs (Fig. 200) until
they are rounded enough to
cling to the sides of the turkey. Use stiff
feathers for the tail, first making holes in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_103">103</span>the turkey in which to insert them (Fig. 199). Push the
feathers in securely, and should they stand up unevenly at
varying heights, trim them carefully with scissors and the
turkey will be finished (Fig. 201).</p>

Study drawing at home and make your
own models; form a class of several
girls and work together; criticise one
another’s drawings, and get a criticism
from an artist whenever you can. Much
may be accomplished in this way if you
have the enthusiasm, perseverance, and
will to carry it through. Starting with
one object, complete in itself, a variety of forms may be
evolved, and combinations can be made until an entirely
new model is produced. Such, for instance, is the church
shown in the illustration. First there is the house, then the
house with a chimney, the house with chimney and one

<p class="c001">Lay a sheet of heavy card-board flat on your work-table
and draw carefully four triangles like Fig. 218. These are for
the four sides of the pyramid. Use a rule
to keep your lines straight, and make
each side according to the dimensions
given on the diagram. You will see that the
measurement from apex to base is ten
inches, and the width at the bottom is six
and one-half inches. With a sharp knife,
or large shears, cut out each part, taking
pains to keep your edges true to the
lines. Besides the card-board you will
need a roll of passe-partout paper. This
comes in one-inch widths, ready gummed,
for making passe-partout frames.
It is strong, easily handled, and altogether
more convenient for joining the
parts of the models than ordinary strips of paper. Should
the passe-partout paper be out of reach use new cotton cloth

cut in even one-inch strips. Of course the cloth or paper
must be white. Cut off a strip of your gummed paper a
little longer than
the long edge of
the triangle. With
a pin at each end,
pin it to the table,
the gummed side
up, and draw a
line lengthwise
through the middle,
dividing it

Have ready a

press another triangle over that part, keeping the edges of
the two triangles perfectly parallel, but not touching. The

half, and press still another triangle
in place; continue doing
this until all four sides of the
pyramid are joined as in Fig. 221;
then bring the last two edges
together, while holding it in your
hand, and press the moistened
paper down, smoothing out any
wrinkles that may appear. Lastly,
trim off the ends of the paper
at the bottom, and stand your
pyramid up, holding it so that its

from rather heavy drawing-paper, like Fig. 242, keeping to
the dimensions on the diagram. Turn in the lower laps and
paste the side lap over the corresponding edge to form a
cone (Fig. 243). Drop a little glue on each of the lower
laps, place the cone directly over the circular hole in the

When you happen to drop ink on paper you
may be using, do not look disconsolate and
feel uncomfortable. Make a joke of the accident
by turning the blot into something funny.
Fold the paper over the ink-spot, press the
two sides together; then open the fold, and
you will find the dull, round blot transformed
into a queer, comical-looking object the like
of which was never seen on land or sea. The
strange thing about these oddities is that try as you
may you cannot coax any two ink-drops to change
themselves into the same shape; they utterly refuse
to do so. Experiment with them and you will soon
realize that each has its own independent idea regarding
the figure it will assume, insisting, when you press it, upon
taking the matter into its own hidden hands and turning
into whatever it pleases. The various results are generally
decorative and might often be used with good effect for
book-plates.</p>

extent. Hold the paper so that the wet ink will trickle
downward, and you can join the blots together, elongating
the design; then, when the paper is folded lightly, if you
<span class="pageno" id="Page_119">119</span>press the ink with short, gentle strokes out sidewise the
tiny splashes tend in that direction, and an upward movement
will cause the ink to spread upward—sometimes in
little streaks, again in a bulging way, giving an uneven, undulating
boundary. Should the paper be folded across the
ink the result would be a single figure, while an allowance
of an eighth or quarter of an inch space before creasing the
paper gives two designs, one a duplicate because a print of
the other. A similar method of making ink-impressions is
to splash the fluid on the paper with a paint-brush and then
to fold and press it; or, group drops of ink with the splash
of a brush and press the two sides of the paper together.</p>

out into the sea for the middle distance, while the foreground
is entirely of water, which reflects the distant
purple hills. The picture is readily made, but the work
must be rapid to insure success, as delays cause the ink to
dry in spots, which ruin the design. Fold through the
centre a piece of blank, unruled paper from a large-sized
writing pad; open it and on the upper portion mark the
sections according to diagram Fig. 245. The dotted line
indicates the crease through the centre of the paper and
gives the distance at which the first sections should be
placed above the fold. With a lead-pencil lightly trace the
divisions: have ready a bottle of ink, a common water-color
brush, a glass of water and a clean dinner-plate. Dip the
brush in the ink and dab it on the plate several times; then
do the same with the water, mixing ink and water together.
Try the strength of this mixture on a scrap of paper; if it
corresponds to the tone of the second point of land in Fig.
244 (or A in the diagram) it is ready for use. B and D
(Fig. 245) require a degree lighter than A, so mix more
water than ink on a clean place in the plate. C (Fig. 245)
is the faintest mountain and needs the most water mixed
with ink. Use ink as it comes from the bottle for E (Fig. 245),
the nearest point of land, as that is the darkest portion. Test
the three tones and keep changing them, adding more water
<span class="pageno" id="Page_121">121</span>as needed, until you are satisfied that each one is of the required
strength; then wash the brush clean and be sure
everything is ready for the work. Having once commenced,
you cannot stop an instant until the sketch is finished; understand

the darker, A, and finish with E in pure

mostly of stringing different things on a hat-pin

a long hat-pin (Fig. 258), a large, empty
spool (Fig. 259), three small corks (Fig. 260)
and, for a foundation, a round flat box if you can obtain or
make it, if not, a common note-paper box must answer the
purpose. A piece of string about a yard long and two
shank buttons will help out the simple machinery (Fig. 259).
The canopy is of paper or card-board (Fig. 261) and the
support for the animals of card-board (Fig. 262).</p>

a face and dress on each of the little girls, being sure to use
the inside of the bend or fold for the front of the doll, as
this slight inclination to fold forward after the doll is cut
out and straightened
out flat is of great
assistance in bracing
the figure when it is
in position. Cut a slit
up between the feet,
but no further. Let
the legs be of one
piece, to insure greater
strength to the standing
doll (Fig. 267).
Fold the flag-staff
lengthwise, also the
hand holding it, and
give to each of the
paper children one of
the home-made tissue-paper
flags by pasting a
flag on every flag-staff (Fig.
268). When the dolls are
ready, obtain a very flexible,
slender, cloth-covered, long steel from a dress-waist or
stays, and tie a strong black thread from end to end, making
a stretch of nine or ten inches. On the centre of this
thread tie another about a yard long (Fig. 265), and on the
steel foundation fasten the four dolls. They should stand
erect, one on each end, and two midway between centre and
ends.</p>

<p class="c001">Fig. 268 shows the method of pasting the feet of the figures
<span class="pageno" id="Page_132">132</span>on the steel; slide the steel up between the feet; then
bend them forward and glue one foot on each side of the
steel, flat against it. Fasten a flag, about four and a half
inches long, on the end of a long, strong hat-pin; then stick
the pin firmly in a small pastry-board and slip the steel with
its pretty children over it, resting the centre of the steel
flat against the pin, which is now a flag-pole (Fig. 265).</p>

This will cause all the paper

Gather up the tail carefully so it will not tangle and set
the ball aside until it

run out in the sunshine
with the comet
in your arms and throw it up as far
as you can toward the blue sky. The
comet will look gorgeous
sailing through
the air. When it comes down, take the

of you as possible. Away it will speed
with a flutter and a dash, a long, brilliant
streak of color (Fig. 301). The tail of the

slender pasteboard mailing tube, or a stick
of bamboo, or a section of some shrub
from which you can push the pith, leaving
a hollow case, will answer the purpose.
Have the hollow stick about eight inches
<span class="pageno" id="Page_145">145</span>long, and for a ramrod cut a smooth, round stick an inch
or two longer. Be sure that the ramrod slides easily

then with the other, leaving the potato
bullets in it exactly as they came from
the slice. When you are ready to fire,
place the ramrod against the
bullet in one end of the pistol
and suddenly push
the ramrod with
force through the  tube, sending the
first bullet flying, and as it leaves the
pistol a loud report will follow. Fig. 303 shows the potato
slice and the bullets which have been used. Should you
be able to find corks which exactly fit the pistol you could
use them instead of potato. Fasten each cork to the end
of a string and tie the string firmly around the centre of

the pistol. Remember that the success of the pistol depends
upon keeping the air bottled up tight in the tube by
having the bullets fit tight. If the air is allowed to escape,
no report will be heard; the bullets will not pop. But
never fear; you will be able to make the pistol; have confidence,
patience, and care, and your work will turn out well.</p>

    <div><b>Sky-rockets</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">are one of the best kind of fireworks and furnish lots of
fun. We will make some and send them flying through
the air.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_146">146</span>Cut strips of paper eighteen inches long
and two inches wide, fringing them seven
inches on one side (Fig. 304). Commence
at the unfringed end, B, and roll them like
lamplighters (Fig. 305), folding each over at
top end to keep it in place (Fig. 306, C).
These are the sky-rockets, and are best
made of stiff, bright-colored paper, but may
be of any kind except very limber paper.
Make a number of sky-rockets and “fire them
off” by the aid of a large, empty
spool with a piece of elastic adjusted
loosely over one end, but tied securely

would send an arrow from a bow.
There is another paper sky-rocket

cut the stick about seven
inches long. Near one end
tie on firmly a stout rubber
band (Fig. 309). The stick of the sky-rocket
should be strong and slender and about
twelve inches in length.  Have it small enough
<span class="pageno" id="Page_147">147</span>in diameter to slide
easily through the
sunflower stalk.
Fasten many gay-colored
streamers of
tissue-paper on one
end, making them
fully a yard in length. When
all is ready, place the stick with
streamers uppermost in the tube,
draw back the rubber band with
the stick (Fig. 310), and fire (Fig.
311). The sky-rocket goes swiftly
through the air, carrying a
stream of paper fire in its wake. As with the real fireworks
you must be careful not to aim any of these in a
direction where they will strike anyone.</p>

<p class="c023">for your work are a piece of glass about six inches square,
a tube of lamp-black oil-paint, some sewing-machine oil, and
a pad of unruled writing-paper.</p>

<p class="c001">See that your glass is perfectly clean and free from dust,
squeeze out some of the black paint in a saucer and mix it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_149">149</span>with a few drops of the machine oil. You will soon learn
the consistency required, for if you make the paint too thin
it will run and blot, and if there is not enough oil it will go
on too thickly and smudge in printing.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Painting</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Choose a photograph or print for your copy which is
simple in effect—that is, one which shows a good deal of sky
and broad stretches of light and shade. It may be either
landscape or marine, but, until you have had some experience
with the work, avoid figure pieces, and architecture. When
you have learned the process be as original as you like, but
keep to your copy at first; you will never make an exact
reproduction. Use whatever kind of a paint-brush seems
best fitted, and work rapidly that the paint may not dry.
A fine soft sponge will give excellent foliage effects; this
should be dipped in the paint and simply dabbed on the
glass. A clean cotton rag will take off extra paint and is
especially useful where water is represented in the picture.
By dragging the rag or sponge over a surface too thickly
painted you can loosen it and give the appearance of grass
and shrubbery, or of a roadway. Soft clouds can be made
by putting the cloth over the end of your finger and rubbing
on the glass with a circular movement, using but little
paint; for an ordinary sky make horizontal strokes with
the rag, keeping the tint as flat as possible. If you place a
piece of white paper under the glass the work will be easier,
for you will appear to be painting on a white surface and
the transparency of the glass will not trouble you.</p>

made of soft silk, or muslin, and raw cotton—indeed, several
pads will be found useful. Cut the silk into a four-inch
square, place in the centre a wad of raw cotton about the
size of a hickory nut, and, drawing the silk smoothly over
the cotton at the bottom, bring it together at the top; wrap
with thread close to the cotton and tie securely.</p>

<p class="c001">Draw the outlines of the face lightly with a fine camel’s-hair
brush, and lay in the shadows broadly with a large
brush; then take your pad and go over the shadows, stippling
them with little dabs until they are smooth and free
from brush strokes. When it is necessary to deepen a
shadow add more paint with the pad.</p>

<p class="c001">Do not put in the features with hard lines, let the face
be modelled with light and shade, making deeper accents
where more sharpness is required. The definite strokes
about the eyes, the nostrils, and the line between the lips
can be made with a brush without hardness. Hard lines
never look well in a monotype; they stand out harshly from
the general softness of the effect, and appear unpleasantly
out of place.</p>

  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Printing</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">When your painting is finished, slightly dampen a piece
of paper by passing a wet sponge across one side, lay the
dampened side carefully on the glass next to the paint, and
then pass both through the clothes-wringer. Remember to
hold the glass as it comes through that it may not fall and
break. Lift your paper off lightly and quickly, without
dragging, and you have the completed monotype, like, and
yet unlike, the picture you painted. In the first place, the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_151">151</span>design is reversed, and then there are often beautiful effects
which your brush could never have produced. If the
painting on the glass still holds, try another print, and even
a third; the first are not always the best.</p>

    <div><b>Monotone Monotypes</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">A very pretty experiment is to use color instead of black
and make a monotone of your monotype. Sepia will give
the picture in soft brown, Indian red in bright red, while
Antwerp blue produces the tone of blue found in a blueprint
photograph. Of course oil colors alone must be used,
water colors will not print.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">

    <div><b>Another Field for Experiment</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">lies in using several colors in one picture. For instance,
you might make your mountains blue, your trees green, and
your foreground red and yellow.</p>

<p class="c001">Then again mixing the colors and using them as if painting
on canvas will prove interesting. The deepest pleasure
in all work of this kind is to experiment and discover
methods for ourselves, then to work out and perfect these
methods and make them all our own.</p>

<p class="c001">There are various</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Papers</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">suitable for monotype painting. Rice-paper is especially
pleasing; it is soft of texture, light of weight, and has a
warm, creamy tone. The monotypes printed upon it are
delicate, clear, and distinct. Imported blotting-paper also
produces satisfactory results, though the print is not quite
<span class="pageno" id="Page_152">152</span>as soft in effect; it has a smooth, rather hard surface, but
takes the paint well. Both of these papers are used dry.</p>

<p class="c001">Some professionals use a Japan paper and a Holland
paper. The Japan paper is very thin, and the Holland
paper has a surface like water-color paper, but is heavier
than the ordinary kind.</p>

<p class="c001">For first efforts the unruled, ten-cent writing pad is the
best. Very good prints can be made on this, and one feels
free to experiment as much as heart desires with such inexpensive
material. The monotypes given here were painted
on writing-paper and imported blotting-paper.</p>

As there is no limit to the
beautiful effects which may be
produced by the well-chosen
color combination in the Priscilla
rag rugs, and anyone who
has an eye for color (which,
by the way, may be cultivated)
is sure of success.</p>

<p class="c001">There are many new inventions
in hand-looms, yet
the old cumbersome loom of
our grandmother’s day is still
to be found in the outlying
districts of most towns and
cities, and the weaving done on this is fully
as satisfactory as that on the new looms. Almost
every village has its rag-carpet weaver, and on his
old-fashioned machine can be woven all that we want in
this line.</p>

<p class="c001">First, there are the all-wool rugs for general use in the
house, then mixed wool and cotton rugs for the piazza, all
cotton for bedroom and bathroom, mixed cotton and silk
and entire silk for portières and couch-covers, and for covers
for sofa-pillows.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_154">154</span>There are also rugs of heavy cotton, such as denim in
its dull reds, blues, yellows, greens, and browns.</p>

<p class="c001">The size of a rug for general use is usually one yard
wide by two yards long, the yard width being the limit of
the ordinary loom. Smaller rugs are woven in different
proportions: a runner for the hall is three-quarters of a yard
wide and of any required length, and door-mats half a yard
wide by one yard long. Squares for the centre of the room
can be made by having two breadths woven exactly alike
and then sewing them together.</p>

<p class="c001">You who possess a loom of even the clumsiest design
have a field open before you full of interest, for freedom to
experiment in pattern and manner of weaving will lead to
continually new results and there will be increasing <a id="corr154.14"></a><span class="htmlonly"><ins class="correction" title="orignality">originality</ins></span><span class="epubonly"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56588/56588-h/56588-h.htm#c_154.14"><ins class="correction" title="orignality">originality</ins></a></span>
and beauty in your productions.</p>

    <div><b>Color Schemes for Rugs</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Collect all your available material, plan your combination
of colors, and then decide whether it will be necessary
to put some of the rags into the dye-pot. If you have a
handsome vase in your room it is a pretty idea to take that
for your keynote and reproduce its color in your rugs.</p>

<p class="c001">Solid colors are the best unless you wish to have part of
your rug what is called “hit or <a id="corr154.23"></a><span class="htmlonly"><ins class="correction" title="miss">miss.</ins></span><span class="epubonly"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56588/56588-h/56588-h.htm#c_154.23"><ins class="correction" title="miss">miss.</ins></a></span>”  For “hit or miss”
any short pieces may be used and sewed together indiscriminately;
then again, if you have a good deal of checked,
plaid, or mingled material, it may be used by itself for
centre or border. It is upon the solid colors, however, that
you must principally rely, as there is less of the element of
chance in their use, and your calculation as to the result of
your color combination will be surer.</p>

<div class="figcenter id085">

<div class="ic003">
<p>Making a Priscilla Rug.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c001">A favorite design is a “hit or miss,” or a solid-colored
<span class="pageno" id="Page_155">155</span>centre with striped ends. A more unconventional effect is
produced by making the rug in stripes of unequal width
and in daring color combinations; some of these latter are
startlingly barbaric and artistic in appearance and are well
adapted to studio use. Again, more harmonious effects are
produced by using various tints and shades of one color.
Very narrow stripes of black and of white often separate
wide stripes of different colors, sometimes singly, sometimes
together, and when used with discretion they give a
certain decision and finish to the whole. You will naturally
want to exercise your own taste and originality in designing
your rugs, so a description of one all-wool rug will be amply
sufficient as a guide.</p>

<p class="c001">This rug is one yard wide by two yards long. The
centre is exactly one yard square and is of solid dark cardinal
red. The two ends are precisely the same and the stripes
of the border follow each other in this order: Next the
centre comes a very narrow stripe of old gold, then one of
the same width of white. These are made by putting the
strips of color only once through the loom, or once across.
After these comes a five-inch stripe of old blue, again the
narrow yellow and white stripes followed by a two-inch
stripe of moss green, a three-inch stripe of dull light blue,
a five-inch stripe of light brown, a two-inch stripe of old
blue, and next the fringe a one-inch stripe of dark cardinal
red. The fringe is simply the warp allowed to extend
beyond the rug about a quarter of a yard at each end.</p>

<p class="c001">Gray is a useful color in all-wool rugs and makes an
effective centre for a bright-colored border.</p>

    <div><b>The Fire Rug</b></div>

color. The ends are dark red, and, by degrees, the red runs
<span class="pageno" id="Page_156">156</span>into orange, which, in turn, melts into dark yellow, growing
gradually lighter until the centre of the rug is a pale, soft
yellow.</p>

<p class="c001">Pale tones of yellows

also yellows

<p class="c001">Before taking
your rug to the
loom tack on a piece

wish them woven,
and write opposite
each sample the
width the stripe is

  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Weight</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">To calculate how much you will need of each color, remember
that it requires about two pounds of woollen rags
to the yard; therefore, if you want half a yard of one color,
one pound will be required; for a quarter of a yard, one-half
pound. Do not make your calculations too closely, with a
little over-weight in each case no harm is done and it is
better than falling short of the required amount. The narrow,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_157">157</span>or once-across, stripes require an inch or two over the
yard for each stripe.</p>

<div class="ic003">
<p>Sew the pieces together<br>in this way.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Cut your rags in strips one-half an inch wide unless the
material is very thin or loosely woven, in which case make
them wider; very heavy cloth should be even narrower than
the half-inch. Cotton rags should be one
inch wide. As the rag’s are pinched
together when woven it is the
thickness that counts, and the
object is to keep them of
an even bulk so that
the rug may not have
an uneven, lumpy surface.
Perhaps you
will be told by the
weaver not to sew
your rags too securely,
for they
cannot be jerked
apart readily when it is necessary to break off one color
to begin weaving the next; but do not act on such advice.
You must sew the strips together with care so that the ends
may not stand out and give a ragged look to the finished
rug. The accompanying diagram shows the best manner of
joining the pieces. You see that one piece is laid over the
end of the other, then both are folded lengthwise and sewed
securely in the fold. This gives smooth joints and an even
surface.</p>

<p class="c001">Wind your different colors into balls, having, as a rule,
one pound in each, and put them in a bag to send to the
loom.</p>

    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_158">158</span><b>Cotton and Wool Rugs</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">For piazza rugs, or for summer cottage use, cotton may
be mixed with the wool; indeed, some hold that it is unnecessary
to have all-wool for any purpose, though the writer
thinks differently. The temptation is great, however, to
use the pretty bits of gingham and lawn left from summer
gowns, and they do give a certain, if not lasting, brilliancy
to the rug. That much of the cotton is apt to fade and
grow shiny with use is of little consequence when the rugs
are not subjected to hard and constant use. Rugs of this
class should be as bright and gay as possible; the combination
of even the crudest colors looks well on a vine-shaded
piazza and in the gayly decked summer cottage.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>All-cotton Rugs</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">For bedroom and bathroom all-cotton rugs are exceedingly
pretty and appropriate, and when they are made of
fast-colored material they may be washed with ease and
kept always fresh and clean.</p>

<div class="figcenter id051">
<img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_158.jpg" alt="" class="ig001">
<div class="ic003">
<p>The Centre may have Dashes of Color through it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c001">White should predominate in these washable rugs, and
the best as well as the simplest effect is produced by combining
<span class="pageno" id="Page_159">159</span>it with but one other color. Indigo blue and turkey
red are safe and useful colors; brown and green gingham
also look well with the white. Of cotton rags allow one
and one-half pounds to the yard. When you are in doubt
as to the permanency of your colors soak the rug, before
washing, in a strong solution of salt and water; this will
“set” almost any color. These cotton rugs may be woven
in alternate strips of color and white, or the white be used
for the centre and the colors for the border, or the centre
may have dashes of color through it as shown in diagram.</p>

<p>In Stripes of Unequal Width.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c001">Bathroom rugs can be entirely of white or, towel-fashion,
have a narrow colored strip at each end. Any
white cotton may be used in these bathroom rugs, old being
better for this purpose than new, as it is much softer.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Warps and Fringe</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Gray linen is undoubtedly the best-wearing warp and
harmonizes with all colors, therefore for all-wool rugs it is
the best. It gives, of course, a gray fringe, but that is not
undesirable. When a colored fringe is wanted the cotton
warp will have to be used. This comes in red, blue, purple,
yellow, and white. Use cotton warp for cotton rugs, and
where the filling is largely white the warp should be white
also. When red warp is used with white filling a pink tone
is the result, while blue and purple with white filling produce
a gray effect.</p>

<p class="c001">At each end of the rug the warp should be woven with
self-filling to the depth of one inch. This makes a heading
for the fringe and prevents the rag filling from ravelling.
It is, in fact, a selvage. You may knot the fringe, using six
strands to a knot, or plat it and then knot as in diagram, or
it may be stitched at the top and left to flow freely.</p>

<p class="c024">Those who make a business of manufacturing rag
rugs scorn to use the dyes that come ready prepared
and think it well worth the extra
trouble to make their dyes themselves.
So it is,
perhaps, when one
has plenty of time
to devote to the
work, but a girl’s
life is so full of interests

she generally
chooses quick
methods, though
the results may
not always be as

Changing one thing into another is
always interesting, and the most charming
part of a Peanut Noah’s Ark is that
you can transform these ground-nuts
into any and every kind of
wild creature. At your command
they will come trooping from all
parts of the tangled jungle, the elephants
leading and tigers, lions,
bears, wolves, kangaroos, giraffes,

many insects, too-the curious peanut
spider, actually as large as one of those mammoth
Southern tarantulas which often travel North on bunches
of bananas, and the enormous hard-shelled hornet, whose
sting will not hurt half as badly as its smaller cousins who
are alive and whose nests are large and round, dark gray in
color and appear as if made of paper. In addition to these
you can have beetles of different kinds, grasshoppers, and
various sorts of moths.</p>

must select a peanut as near like Fig. 312 as you can find.
This is for the thorax or chest; choose a longer nut, resembling
Fig. 313, for the abdomen or body. Take six common
wooden toothpicks for the legs (Fig. 314), and bend
each stick until it fractures near the centre without breaking
(Fig. 315). For the waist use a short piece of toothpick
(Fig. 316). For the sting take a pin (Fig. 317). To insert

waist of the hornet, as shown in Fig. 318. This done, put
three legs on each side of the insect by forcing the toothpicks
into the thorax or chest peanut (Fig. 318).</p>

<p class="c001">Now we have a huge ant, and as ants are practically
wingless hornets, some of them even having stings like the
bee tribe, it is only necessary to add a pair of wings to complete
the terrible peanut hornet. If you have any tracing-paper
or the waxed paper from a candy-box, the semi-transparent
material will form wonderfully natural wings; but
any kind of paper will make</p>

<p class="c023">With a pencil draw the pattern (Fig. 319) upon a bit of
paper, fold at the dotted line and you will have Fig. 320.
With the scissors cut around the outline through both
leaves of the folded paper; the result will be Fig. 321, the
two wings joined together. Paste them on the back of the
thorax, and you will have Fig. 322. To make it look still
more lifelike, ink stripes across its back and head, and stick
in the front of the head two fine, small black pins for the
antennæ. To prove that this is a live hornet, let anyone
who doubts the fact press the end of his finger on the point
of the sting and he will be satisfied. Should he still claim
that the thing is not alive, dip your finger in a glass of water
and allow a drop of the fluid to fall on each joint of the legs
where the wood is fractured; the swelling of the wet wood
<span class="pageno" id="Page_166">166</span>will cause the legs to move in a manner sufficiently lifelike
to satisfy the most critical.</p>

<p class="c023">but the newly discovered specimen known as the <i>Peanuticus
spiderencus</i> is one which the most dainty little girl may eat
without feeling at all nervous as to consequences. Spiders
differ in many respects
from true
insects, but we
need only observe
the most
obvious points of
divergence.</p>

<p class="c001">First, they have
no waist; that is,
their body is jammed
upon their
thorax (Fig. 323).
Next, their heads
are driven into
their shoulders,
so to speak, so that they not only have no neck, but there is
not even a line to indicate where the head ends and the
thorax or chest begins.</p>

<p class="c001">From the quart of peanuts select one which looks most
like Fig. 323. Spiders have more legs than beetles or wasps.
Garden spiders have eight well-defined legs, and our <i>Peanuticus</i>
belongs to the garden spider family. Therefore, take
eight toothpicks and, bending them as before described, make
eight legs. Push two legs into each side of the large part
<span class="pageno" id="Page_167">167</span>of the nut—the abdomen—inclining them backward, and two
more into each side of the small part of the nut—the thorax—slanting
them forward, as in Fig. 324. Make the antennæ
of two black pins, bent according to Fig. 325; push the
pins well into the head of the spider (Fig. 324). If you
thread a fine piece of black elastic through the spider’s
back, allowing a length of about a half yard, and weight the
body by fastening a little flattened piece of lead or a small
stone on the under part with melted sealing-wax, the <i>Peanuticus</i>
can be made to dance up and down in the air like a
natural spider running on its web. The black elastic will
not be noticeable. Tie the end of the elastic on a stick;
then you can hold it out from you and have a better view
of the curious creature.</p>

charming pastime; so this is written
for girls of all ages.</p>

colors you like into your baskets, and
see if they are not much prettier and
more substantial than the so-called
“Indian work.” Red, blue, green,

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Materials for Weaving</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">A variety of materials are adapted to basket-weaving, but
the most substantial baskets are made of reeds. When the
principle is mastered you may use anything you choose
which will lend itself to the work.</p>

<p class="c001">The basket-reeds can be purchased from any reed and
rattan manufacturer, and come in various sizes. Nos. 2, 3,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_186">186</span>and 4 are the ones to use, and as No. 4 is quite heavy you
will need that only for large baskets, such as waste-paper
baskets, flower-pot cases, etc., and even for such purposes
No. 3 will answer. No. 2 is the finest, and of that you will
use the most. The prices range from twenty-three cents to
thirty-five cents a pound, No. 2 being the most expensive.
Beside the reeds you will need a twist of raffia; this is a
soft material used by the florist for tying up plants, and
may be obtained from him at little cost, probably eighteen
or twenty cents a hank.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>To Prepare the Reeds</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">The reeds come in bunches of five pounds each; separate
these, and taking each reed wrap it loosely around your
hand to form a coil, twisting the ends in and out to hold them
in place. This puts your material into a convenient form,
and you need unwrap the reeds only as you have use for
them, one at a time. Have ready a pan or pail full of water,
for the reeds must be soaked awhile before they are used
to make them more pliable and to keep them from breaking.</p>

<p class="c001">Try a small basket at first—let us say a rather flat, shallow
one—and for this one coil of No. 3 and several of No.
2 reeds will be enough. When they have soaked for about
five minutes take out the No. 3 reed, unwrap it, and cut six
pieces twelve inches long and one piece eight inches long;
then untwist your raffia and cut off one strip.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Weaving the Basket</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">The reeds you have just cut are for the ribs of your
basket. Lay the short rib to one side within easy reach,
then take three of the ribs in your left hand and cross them
with the other three, as in Fig. 382. Be sure the reeds lie
<span class="pageno" id="Page_187">187</span>flat and side by side; do not bunch them. Hold the ribs
where they are crossed between the thumb and first finger
<span class="fltright kd150"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_187-fig382.jpg" alt="Fig. 382." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 382.</span></span>
of your left hand, the vertical ones
on top, as shown in Fig. 382, and
with your right hand place one end
of the raffia on top of the reeds,
under your left thumb, leaving the
free end to fall to the left, as in Fig.
382. Hold the ribs securely now,
and bring the raffia up under those
on the left-hand side close to the
crossing, then over the upper ribs
(Fig. 383), under the right-hand ribs
and over the lower ones, going
<span class="fltleft kd150"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_187-fig383.jpg" alt="Fig. 383." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 383.</span></span>
around twice and catching down the
end of the raffia in the process; then
trim off the remaining short end of
the raffia. Do not loosen your hold
with your left hand, but with your
right separate the ribs as well as
you can and begin to weave the
raffia, starting at the left-hand rib of
the upper group, as shown by letter
A, Fig. 384. Bring the raffia over
<span class="fltright kd150"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_187-fig384.jpg" alt="Fig. 384." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 384.</span></span>
this rib and draw it down close to
the centre, then under the next, over
the third, under the fourth, and so
on until you have been once around,
when you will find another rib necessary
to make the weave come out
properly. Here is the place for the
short rib; place one end of this rib
across the centre of the others, as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_188">188</span>shown by letter B, Fig. 385, and hold in place with your
left thumb. Bring the raffia over the new rib, and continue
<span class="fltleft kd150"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_188-fig385.jpg" alt="Fig. 385." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 385.</span></span>
weaving as in the first round; when
you reach the short end of the rib
bind it down with the raffia as you
carry it over one of the other ribs, as
shown by letter C, Fig. 386. Weave
steadily with the raffia now, and keep
your mind on separating the ribs until
they are of an equal distance apart;
also remember to draw the raffia down
firmly each time you pass it in and
out between the ribs, first on one
side, then on the other. Of all parts
it is most essential that the centre
<span class="fltright kd150"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_188-fig386.jpg" alt="Fig. 386." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 386.</span></span>
of the basket should be firmly and
strongly woven. Be careful not to
weave under or over two ribs at one
time. Under one, over the next, is
the rule; and when you find, as you
will occasionally, that something is
wrong, and alternate weaving has
become impossible, look back over
your work and you will discover
that you have somewhere crossed
<span class="fltleft kd150"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_188-fig387.jpg" alt="Fig. 387." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 387.</span></span>
two ribs at once. In such a case
pull out the work and correct the
mistake.</p>

<p class="c001">Weave the raffia until the centre
is about two inches in diameter, or
until you have used up the raffia,
then take from the water a coil of the No. 2 reeds, unwind
it, and placing one end across the end of the raffia, hold it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_189">189</span>with the thumb of your left hand, and proceed to weave
with the reed just as you did with the raffia (Fig. 387). In
all cases the joining must
be done on the inside of
the basket.</p>

If this slips up in the process,
push it back in place

way to hold your basket as soon as the ribs are sufficiently
separated. Your left hand follows your right always in

<p class="c023">take another, cross the
ends, and continue as you
did when beginning with
the first reed. As your weaving progresses do not forget
to keep the distances between all of the ribs equal, and
try to avoid the tendency they have to curve spirally.
When your basket has slanting sides you will find it will
<span class="pageno" id="Page_190">190</span>almost shape itself after you have given the ribs a sharp
bend at the first and started them in the right direction.
By bending the ribs too much you will make straight sides
to the basket or have them slant in instead of out. Two
inches is a good depth for a small basket, and when you
have woven that much, cut off the ribs, allowing them to
extend about two inches beyond the edge, as in Fig. 389,
and trim the ends slantingly, as shown in the same diagram.
Bend the end of one rib down, and push it into the basket
on the farthest side of the next rib (Fig. 389). Do this with
the second rib, and so continue around until the edge is
“bound off.” When the ends of the ribs do not slide in
easily, pry open the space with a pair of closed scissors,
turning them slightly.</p>

tightening the weave when
narrowing and loosening
it when widening. There
is a difference, of course,
in the length of the ribs,
the larger baskets requiring
longer ribs and more of
them, but there must always
be an even number to start with, the odd rib being
added after the first round of raffia-weaving.</p>

<p class="c001">It is difficult to handle more than ten ribs at the start, but
where the basket is large or a close weave is desirable you
may double the number when the disk for the bottom is
almost complete. To do this, cut a number of the ribs one-half
<span class="pageno" id="Page_191">191</span>the length of the ones you have started with, and after
trimming the ends as in Fig. 389, insert one at the right of
each of the original ribs, as shown in Fig. 390, pushing each
well down toward the centre. This will give you an even
number once more, so a third rib must be added to one of
the groups, and should be inserted at the left, the original

This ring should be about one-fourth of an inch from the

made in the same manner, and should be placed one-half

The soft broken colors,
brightened at times by
touches of more brilliant tones, are really beautiful, while
even those which, alone, seem crude and glaring, by some
happy accident of combination often produce charming

<p class="c023">that bands of color should be so placed as to give the idea
of additional strength to the object decorated—that is, on
the most exposed parts, such as the fullest swell of a curve
and the base and edge. You will find that this rule is observed
in most decorated pottery, and it is a good one to
follow in basket-weaving; the nearer one comes to embodying
it in the work, the more satisfactory are the results.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_193">193</span>Another style of decoration is to start with a dark color

A bright, gray-eyed little Kentucky
boy, of whom all have heard and
whose memory is honored by the
entire nation, lived years ago in a
quaint log-cabin so small that it
would now seem to be about the
right size for a large play-house.
There was but one room, and that
contained only a few pieces of
rough home-made furniture. The
boy, with his musical laugh, was busy and healthy, making
the best of everything and sleeping soundly on the dried
leaves piled in one corner of the loft over the room. There
were no stairs for the little fellow to ascend, so he climbed
to his primitive couch by means of wooden pegs driven in
the side of the wall. He never complained of any hardship,
but always tried to better things; and after he grew up to
manhood he tried to better his country, and succeeded.</p>

<p class="c001">Imagine this brave boy dressed in the every-day costume
of the place and times, wearing a 'coon-skin cap which
partially covered his thick dark hair, a homespun shirt,
trousers of roughly tanned deerskin, and on his feet, not
shoes, but home-made moccasins. Thus attired, he daily
trudged by the side of his sister Nancy, walking several
<span class="pageno" id="Page_195">195</span>miles to a school-house, which was also built of logs, so
arranged that they stuck out and formed little recesses in
which the children played hide-and-seek. There were no
windows in the building; the day crept through the open
space where a log had been removed to admit light to
enable the girls and boys to see to study. The school floor
was the bare brown earth, not even boards; yet from such
modest surroundings came one of the greatest of Americans.
Could you have been at the World’s Fair in 1893 you might
have seen a log-cabin which was the home of this boy after
the family had moved to Illinois. The house was on exhibition
at the Fair, having been purchased for the purpose
by a special association.</p>

<p class="c001">Probably not many Northern girls have ever seen a
genuine log-cabin, though some may have spent part of
their Summer vacation in recently built log-houses in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_196">196</span>mountains, but these buildings are usually too luxurious
and spacious to bear any resemblance to the pioneer structure
of logs. The rare human life which has passed through
some of these old log-cabins and left its influence upon
the world, will cause the cabins to be remembered long
after the more pretentious mansions have been forgotten.
It is noble lives which are of real worth, not inanimate
things.</p>

<p class="c001">Naturally you would be glad to see the funny little
Kentucky log-cabin where Nancy’s brother first lived, but
long ago the cabin was torn down; however, the logs were
saved, and in 1895 the old house was rebuilt on the original
site. The surest way of seeing a log-cabin like the one in
which our little friend and his sister lived is for you to
erect such a house. Then you will know exactly what little
“Abe’s” home was like—for you must have guessed before
this that Nancy’s brother was the martyred President,
Abraham Lincoln.</p>

firm and to avoid wide spaces
between the logs. Let the
elevation or height of the
house be four inches (Fig.
396). In building the roof use
end logs graduated in length (Fig. 397). These gabled ends
should raise the house two inches through the centre. Before
<span class="fltleft kd250"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_197-fig396.jpg" alt="Fig. 396." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 396.</span></span>
adding the roof,
slide in two extra
side logs, each half
an inch or so longer
than the side logs
proper; place one at
each end of the top
of the house along
the inside of the last
logs on top of the
side walls (Fig. 398,
F E). The longer logs are used to extend the roof back
and front beyond the building, causing it to project as do
<span class="fltright kd225"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_197-fig397.jpg" alt="Fig. 397." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 397.</span></span>
the roofs on real houses.
To produce a like result
on the sides, have the
front and back logs of
the roof longer than
those built in the front
and back of the house,
the difference being the
same increase in measurement
as in the sides of the roof (Fig. 396, A B and C D).</p>

<p class="c001">Cut a piece of paper two and one-quarter inches long
<span class="pageno" id="Page_198">198</span>and one and one-quarter inches wide to indicate the door;
fasten it by the four corners to the centre of the front of the
house immediately above the foundation log. Cut another
piece of paper the size of the window—one inch long and
three-quarters of an inch wide—and
<span class="fltleft kd225"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_198-fig398.jpg" alt="Fig. 398." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 398.</span></span>
paste it also on the front of
the house midway between the
door and the end of the house,
allowing it to come a little lower
than the top of the door (Fig.
396). With paint-brush and white
paint mark the logs along the
edge of the paper door and window;
then carefully take down
the house, placing the logs in
eight different piles: the front of the roof in one place, back
of roof in another, first end of roof in the third pile, and
second end in the fourth. Tie each group of logs separately
and label. Proceed in like manner with the four sides of
the house proper, first removing the pieces of paper. Cut
the logs marked with the white paint on the inside of the
lines to make openings for the door and window, then rub
off the remaining paint from the logs.</p>

<p class="c023">and you must find some land upon which to erect the house.
Fortunately log-cabins need no cellars, so digging will be
unnecessary, and the ground need not be deep. A piece of
bookbinder’s stiff pasteboard or a light-weight wooden
board seventeen by twenty-three inches or thereabouts will
prove the best kind of a ground plot and, after space is reserved
for the house, will allow for a large yard. Mark the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_199">199</span>location for the house a little to one side of the centre and
near the back of the lot, as shown in illustration of An
“Abe” Lincoln Log-cabin.</p>

<p class="c001">Have ready some strong glue and begin the building of
the cabin. Glue down the four foundation logs to the
board, being cautious to lay them straight and even;
then proceed as when first erecting the
building, only this time glue each log
to the lower ones at the notched ends,
using putty in place of mortar between
the lengths of the logs. Now, do not
say you have no putty. If you cannot
get it, use plaster-of-paris; if you have
no plaster-of-paris, use clay; and if there is no clay use mud.
The ends of the logs bordering the window and doorway
must be held level and kept from falling together by
chips glued in between them (Fig. 399).</p>

<p class="c001">Be sure to have the four sides of the building plumb.
Do not let the walls lean one way or another. This item
must be borne in mind constantly while building.</p>

desired width and length
for jambs. Glue the pieces
in place. Fig. 400 shows
the first jamb on one side
of the doorway. When all
the jambs are fastened on
measure the space of the
doorway and cut a door of the thin wood according to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_200">200</span>measurements. Be sure it fits, and see that it moves easily
back and forth. The door cannot have a knob, because
during those early times there were no door-knobs in this
country—people used door-latches, mostly of wood, with
a string hanging down on the outside for friends to pull
and thereby lift the inside latch, causing the door to open.
<span class="fltleft kd100"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_200-fig401.jpg" alt="Fig. 401." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 401.</span></span>

If the household did not wish
visitors the string was pulled
inside the room; then no one
outside could open the door, as
there would not be anything to
catch hold of. This explains the
old saying, “The latch-string
hangs on the outside of the
door.” Bore a hole through the
little cabin door with the red-hot
end of a hair-pin, for the latch-string; move the hair-pin
around and around in order to burn the hole large enough
to admit the threading through of a string. Dampen one
end of a short string, twist it to a point and pass it through
the hole to the other side, turn the door over and make a
knot in the end of the string large enough to prevent it

poles at wide intervals,
that the roof may resemble
the original clapboard
style. In real
houses these poles
were laid across to hold the rough clapboards
in position and have them “break joints,”
which means that the clapboards, which resemble
very long, large shingles, are placed
in rows in such a way that the centres of the
solid bottom edges of those in the upper rows
overlap and cross the spaces between
the clapboards in the lower rows,

Having securely glued the lower part of the chimney and
plastered it between the logs, get some burnt matches or
split a number of sticks into very slender lengths for the remainder
of the chimney. These are not to be notched. Use
them to graduate the chimney up
a short distance until the opening
is small enough for the chimney
proper. Make the
rest uniform in
size and
extend it up an inch and a quarter higher than the top of
the house (Fig. 405). If the chimney was a real one it
would have to be plastered thick inside with mud, and
between the logs and sticks, but as it will not be used for
fire or smoke, glue will answer at the corners and putty or
some other substitute for the cracks, as in the illustration of

and weather-beaten fences, and a few varieties are to be had
in the open fields; that growing in pine woods or rocky
places is generally satisfactory. Gather the moss wherever
you can find it and obtain as many varieties as possible.
Look also for the beautiful lichens, varying in color and
form; detach them carefully and bring the curious little
plants home in a box separate from the moss. The dainty
lichens do not need preparation for use, but the moss does.
Place it top down on paper near the fire and dry quickly
without scorching. After it is dry shake off all impurities,
such as dead leaves, grass, sand, and rotten wood. Moss
that grows in swamps should be carefully washed soon
after being obtained, as the roots are difficult to clean when
they become dry. As soon as the moss has been thoroughly

The bark should be of a rich dark reddish-brown on the inside.
Cut it with an old pair of scissors into the desired
shape and size; then place the pieces between two smooth
boards to dry. Put weights or stones of convenient size
upon the upper board, and very soon the bark will be flattened
out and ready for use.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_204">204</span>The trees are small, branching twigs. Search for those
which resemble most closely little trees. Examine carefully
the structure of real trees, stand under the branches and
gaze up into the foliage; in most varieties, you can see
exactly how the tree grows. Try to remember its appearance;
where and how the limbs stand out and the manner
in which they branch off; then select your twigs accordingly.</p>

lake of real water, reflecting the beautiful
green shore, the overhanging
trees,
and the graceful
little craft which
we will moor to
its shore. If the
mirror is the
requisite size, its
shape does not
matter. Place the glass

board at the left-hand
side. Move it further back, then forward, a little
to this side and that, until you find the precise spot best
<span class="pageno" id="Page_205">205</span>suited for the lake. Experimenting in this way, you will
gain unconsciously a slight insight into the art of landscape
gardening, and when you have an opportunity you will find
yourself studying the arrangement and beauty of grounds
laid out by professional landscape gardeners. You will
notice in what direction the water lies from the house, the
arrangement of the trees, if they are many or few, in groups
or scattered, the surface of the land, and various other
details that appeal to the close observer.</p>

<p class="c001">Having located the place for the lake, lay the broken
mirror on it and glue a strip of paper, half of it to the edge
of the glass and half to the board. Fig. 406 shows the
method, the dotted line giving the extreme edge of the glass
under the paper. Cover the paper with a light coat of glue
and sprinkle clean, fine, dry sand over it while the glue is

it and the front edge of the board. Decide upon the
exact location and over this draw
a square measuring one and three-quarters
inches each way as a
guide in building the wall. You
will need some small stones for
the well, but real stones are not
necessary and you may use instead irregular broken
pieces of cork. These can be made to resemble

hard stones by being first coated all over with
glue, then covered with sand of a dark reddish
hue.</p>

<p class="c001">Build the square according to and immediately
outside the lines in order to keep the
inside space of the well large enough to allow
the free lowering of the bucket. Make the
walls even and straight, gluing the foundation
stones securely to the ground. When the first
layer of stones is in place fit in others for a
second row on top of the first, breaking joints;
cement the two rows together with putty. Keep on building
until the walls are an inch and a
half high, reserving the flattest
stones for the top (Fig. 408).</p>

long and push the  end in a button-mould
(Fig. 409); glue the button-mould down tight to
the board at the right-hand side six inches from the well;
then make a straight, slender pole five inches long from a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_207">207</span>twig, and a well-sweep from a heavier twig. The well-sweep
should be fourteen inches long and much heavier at
one end than at the other. On the light end of the sweep
attach the slender pole, which has previously had a hole
burned through the lower end with the red-hot end of a hairpin.
Glue a small strip of brown muslin from one stick to
the other, not allowing the ends of the stick to meet (Fig.
410). Wrap and glue the sides of the cloth around the two
poles, forming in this way a hinge, which will allow the slender
pole to hang straight down from the sweep (Fig. 411).</p>

(Fig. 412) on the end of the pole, pass a string under the
handle of the bucket and through the hole in the poles
then fasten securely. Pierce one of the forked
ends of the stick (Fig. 409), with a pin, measure
seven and a half inches from the smaller, light
end of the sweep, and insert the pole sweep at
this point between the forked ends shown in
Fig. 413. Push the pin entirely through the
sweep and the second fork of the support, where it will act
as a hinge. Try moving the sweep up and down to see if
it works all right.</p>

<p class="c001">Should the bucket drop into the well and remain there
when your hand is removed from the pole, it shows that the
heavy end of the sweep is too light. Remedy this by
increasing the weight. Tack and glue a small box on the
end (Fig. 414), resting the pole exactly on the centre of the
inside bottom of the box. Fill the box with small stones
until the weight is sufficient to keep that end on the ground,
glue the stones in tight (Fig. 413). Now try the sweep
again; pull the pendant pole down, bringing the bucket into
<span class="pageno" id="Page_208">208</span>the well just as the real ones are worked. You can pretend
that the well is very deep, containing the clearest and
coldest of drinking water, and that the acorn
bucket is in reality the original “Old Oaken
Bucket.” That famous bucket actually hung
from just such a sweep as you have made,
only, of course, a very much larger and
stronger one.</p>

push the

small, enlarge it. Have a few very small twigs for shrubs;
stand the trees and shrubs around the
grounds as you think they will look best.
Try placing them in
different parts of the
grounds—perhaps a
large tree partially back of the house
would look well. When all are satisfactorily
arranged mark the different
spots, then take each tree and bush
<span class="pageno" id="Page_209">209</span>separately and cause the bare branches to burst forth into
beautiful green foliage. To do this, bring out your box of
moss and carefully select the variety which most
nearly resembles foliage. Use different kinds of
moss for different trees, if you have a variety.
Pick the dainty moss apart fibre by fibre and
glue the pieces one at a time on the branches,
making the foliage thicker in some places than
in others; place the lightest-colored moss on the
outside limbs of the trees, leaving the darker for the
inner branches. Fig. 415 shows a bare tree and
Fig. 416 the same in full leaf. When the trees and
shrubs are ready glue them by their button-mould stands

When Lincoln was a boy he excelled in splitting rails and
made more and cut them faster than any of the other boys.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_211">211</span>The rails you require, however, are so small that a girl as
well as a boy can easily make them. Cut the logs four and
one-half inches long and split each one lengthwise (Fig.
417). Make enough rails to lay a fence around three sides
of the grounds. The back edge of the land can be hedged
in with bushes and trees. Build the fence by first placing
stones—one or more, according to the size—in two rows,
those in each being about four inches apart. The circles in
Fig. 418 give the position of the stones, and the dotted line
that of the rails. Begin the fence by laying the first rail on
two of the stones, the next rail across to the third stone,
and so on. Make the fence several rails high; then cross
two upright rails at each corner and build on the top rails
(Fig. 419). Glue the stones to the ground and the rails one
on top of the other as you build.</p>

Look at a piece of blank paper or, better still,
stand before an unmarked blackboard
and try to imagine pictured on its surface
whatever you would like to see
there. It might be a comical little
turtle, a rose, or perhaps a graceful
swan. If you knew exactly the true
shape and proportion of the objects you
could draw them, but as soon as you
attempt the sketch you realize that you
cannot remember just how these creatures are formed,
and consequently you are unable to depict them. Do not
be discouraged, for there is a way in which you may do the
work easily and that is by reducing the realistic drawing
to a few leading lines, and the girls who are able to sketch
even a small number of simple objects in this way have
resources within themselves both for diversion and development,
worth much more than they are apt to understand.</p>

leaves according to
the copy. The easiest
way to sketch in
the leaves is to first
draw the mid rib or central line which
reaches from the point
of the topmost leaf to its juncture
with the stem of the rose.
When that line is made draw
two more, branching out on
each side of it. These lines
form the skeleton of the
leaves, and all one has to do
to finish them is to commence at the tip of each line and
draw a curve to its base, first on one side, then on the other,
to form the leaf.</p>

<p class="c001">Is not that easy? Should the work be incorrect the first
<span class="pageno" id="Page_220">220</span>time, do it over again and again. Only little animals are
born with a knowledge of all they are required to know;
people must learn everything, even how to walk. Remember
that the women and men who seem so skilled and wise
had to learn by repeated trials, just as you are doing now.</p>

Draw two curves on the egg for the eyebrows

the eyebrows and exactly in the centre
of the face for eyes (Fig. 447); another
curve midway down between the eyes and
the bottom of the chin for the nose (Fig.

Continue the line to make the upper part of the head (Fig.

<p class="c023">with its golden centre. First draw a small circle to represent
the centre, and as the texture of its surface is slightly
rough or velvety, differing in this respect from the surface
of the white petals, indicate the difference by covering the
centre with tiny dots. From the edge of the centre sketch
in the petals of the flower by drawing, for the sides of each
one, two long, curved lines which start from the round
dotted centre and end by meeting at the outermost tips.
Make a number of petals extending entirely around the circumference
of the centre. Let them radiate out in all
<span class="pageno" id="Page_226">226</span>directions as the spokes stand out from the hub of a wheel,
being careful to have the petals about the same length, that
the daisy may be circular in form and not uneven.</p>

<p class="c001">Always make the designs large in size, drawing the lines
in with free, easy sweeps of the wrist and arm. Never allow
your work to become cramped; move the pencil or chalk
deliberately and think what you are going to do before
starting. Satisfy yourself as to where you are to begin and
where you are going to stop; then do your best.</p>

<p class="c001">The duck of fancy loops (Fig. 473) does not portray the
characteristic lines of the bird. Such was not the intention;
it is merely given for the fun of twisting the lines into the
form of a duck, so that you may be able to say, “I can draw
a duck without taking the pencil from the paper. Watch
me!” Then you draw it for the benefit of your friends.</p>

a few friends or the members of your family. As you
sketch the objects tell in an easy, natural manner anything
and everything you know about them. And before you
are aware of the fact you will be giving others a delightful
half-hour, besides enjoying it yourself.</p>

in form, but you can have more real fun with it than you
could with any of the big, costly affairs. Get some elastic
bands and a deep, empty cigar-box; drive slender nails at
intervals along the front and back edges of the box; then
take ordinary elastic bands (Fig. 486), and stretch them
across the box by slipping each one over two back and two
front nails. The elastics must be of various widths; place
the heaviest at one end of the box and graduate up to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_229">229</span>lightest at the other (Fig. 487). With a quill (Fig. 488) test
the instrument. You can tighten the elastics by looping them
around and around one or more of the four pins; in this way
the strings may to a great extent be keyed as you wish.
Practise on the musical box with the quill toothpick until
you can make the elastics sing a tune, then put the harp
carefully aside where it will not be broken, and hunt up a
piece of wood for a modern</p>

look until you call “Ready.” Then go to work and surprise
her with a miniature representation of one of the most
beautiful temples ever built. Begin by standing four spools
in a row for the first side of the building, allowing about the
width of a spool between each two. Place eight in a row
for the second, four for the third, and eight for the fourth
side. Have the spools all of the same size, that the walls
may be alike and perfectly even, because, as you know, the
walls are to be formed of columns, not as many as in the
original, but enough to give an idea of the Greek temple.
Build up the spools three deep into pillars; then lay a piece
<span class="pageno" id="Page_237">237</span>of pasteboard on the top of the columns for a ceiling.
Bend another piece of pasteboard lengthwise through the
centre for the roof, and stand it tent-like on top of the ceiling.

You can measure

a piece of pasteboard
down flat on
the floor along the
eight-columned side
of the Parthenon to
obtain the length,
and placing it flat
on the floor across the four-columned side to mark the
width. Make the roof the same length and a little wider

columns inside the ones you have built. Your mother will
be greatly interested and can tell you all about the real
Parthenon, and probably will hunt up a picture of the temple

partially into the hole, bend the hairpin
slightly down against the edge of the
hole, do the same with three more hair-pins,
and you will have a spool with a funnel-like
opening of hair-pins at the top (Fig. 513).
In the funnel place a small, light-weight
ball made of a crushed bit of bright paper
wound around with thread. Raise the spool
to your lips and blow gently (Fig. 514).
The ball will rise and fall in mid-air, in the

the brisk greetings of a

and pour it over two quarts

hands, make into balls about
the size of lemons, suspend
the sweet, white ornaments
from the twigs, and use the
remaining corn for a different

lot of the flower-like kernels
with a large needle
and strong thread, loop the
strands from branch to

ropes will lighten up the foliage
beautifully (Fig. 542).</p>

<p class="c001">Most of the ideas given are for a daytime Christmas tree
where lights are not used. If candles are employed, no
paper festoons can be placed on the tree. Lights are always
dangerous, and the tree may be quite brilliant without

“Christmas gift! Christmas gift!
Ah, I've caught you! Hand over my
present!” With a gay laugh the children
exchange this salutation, without
a thought of the request ever being
granted, but simply for the fun of being
the first to call out the Christmas greeting.
Sometimes the forfeit is paid, usually
with a handful of nuts or candy, a
pretty trifle or anything the captive happens to have convenient
at the moment. The giver enjoys the fun fully as
much as the recipient, and with a hop, skip, and jump departs
in hopes of likewise finding a fellow-playmate or some
member of the family off guard, that she may, in turn, be the
first to wish a “Merry Christmas” and claim a gift.</p>

<p class="c001">Cover the outside of a new tin pan with plaited white

bottom edges. Decide on the number of gifts you intend
the pie to contain, and cut a corresponding number of slits
in the circular piece of white tissue-paper which is to form
<span class="pageno" id="Page_261">261</span>the top crust (Fig. 552). Wrap each present in a bright-colored

sure to fasten the knot on
top of the package securely,
so there will be no possibility
of its slipping from the
parcel when it is jerked out
of its bed of bran. Fill the
pan with bran or sawdust,
arrange the gifts on top in
the order you wish, then
put more bran over the
parcels, heaping it in the
centre; thread each ribbon
through its respective slit in the cover and bring the cover

over the pudding
without tearing.
Gather the edge
a little at a time
with your fingers, and paste it down over the sides (Fig. 554).</p>

<p class="c001">Paste a double-edged fringe of white tissue-paper around
the top edge of the pie.
To do this, fold several

cut in a fringe (Fig.

gather it in the centre
with thread and needle,
and at short distances
<span class="pageno" id="Page_262">262</span>sew on tiny bells; then fasten the fringe in place
(Fig. 557). Puncture a hole with a large needle in the
centre of the top of the pie, and insert

<p class="c001">Two wooden
packing boxes, one
about four feet
square and a foot
and a half deep, the
other somewhat
smaller but of nearly
the same depth,
form the framework
of the fireplace.
Stand the large box
on its side—the
longest side if the
box is not exactly
square—and the
smaller box within it as shown by Fig. 558. Remove the
top pieces of both boxes (A B, Fig. 558), and over the top
of the small box tack a piece of doubled light-weight wrapping
paper. At each end of this false cover fasten securely
a piece of strong twine, then puncture two small holes near
the centre of the paper and pass the ends of the twine
through them, drawing it down as shown by letters C D,
Fig. 559. Saw the board, which was taken from the top of
the small box, into two pieces, and place them in a slanting
<span class="pageno" id="Page_264">264</span>position reaching from the top edge of the small box to the
upper corners of the large one (letters E F, Fig. 560). The
<span class="fltleft kd200"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_264-fig558.jpg" alt="Fig. 558." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 558.</span></span>
boards are kept from slipping
by small nails driven half way
into the edge of the small
box. Cover the spaces at the
sides and top, between the
two boxes, with heavy brown
wrapping paper, tacking it
smoothly down along the
edges. This paper should be
marked to represent bricks.
Pile a few sticks of charred wood on the inside hearth
<span class="fltright kd200"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_264-fig559.jpg" alt="Fig. 559." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 559.</span></span>
and, to make it appear that
they are still smouldering, tack
red tinsel paper upon them
here and there.</p>

<p class="c001">Into the receptacle at the
top of the mantel (letter G,
Fig. 560) place all the presents,
resting them upon the paper top of the small box. Things

that are easily broken should
be covered with soft wrappings,
for in the grand climax,
when the toys roll pell-mell
down into the fireplace, the
fragile articles might come to
grief.</p>

<p class="c001">When the last package has
been stowed away, replace the
top of the large box. Decorate
the completed fireplace
with evergreen, and bring the two strings, C and D, which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_265">265</span>hang down upon the hearth, outside, looping them back
over tacks at either side of the fireplace, as shown in Fig.
560.</p>

<p class="c001">At the appointed time the group of eager children will
stand and gaze with awe at the wonderful and mysterious
fireplace, which, like a fairy house, has shot up in a
night.</p>

<p class="c001">Two persons, one on either side, must grasp the strings
tightly, and simultaneously give a pull. With a ripping,
tearing sound the paper gives way and whiz! bump! bang!
the toys come tumbling down, rolling and bounding out on
the floor.</p>

<p class="c001">Because it is Christmas we find ourselves longing to
render little services, to make others happy and cause their
eyes to brighten and sparkle with pleasure, for this is the
season of giving as well as receiving, and the privilege belongs

<p class="c001">Have a Christmas tree for a centre-piece (Fig. 561), a
very modest yet charming little affair—only a wee tree
fashioned from a branch of boxwood, beautified with homemade
toys and decorations cut from gilt and bright-colored
papers. Use a large-sized button-mould for the tree
stand; push the end of the stem into the hole in the centre
of the mould, and the tree will stand alone. Should
you have no boxwood, take any green twig and turn
it into a miniature Christmas tree by trimming off the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_266">266</span>ends of the branches until the little tree somewhat resembles
a cone in shape. It will require only a few moments to

make the tree, and
the sick child will exclaim
with pleasure
at the sight of it.</p>

rest of the meal is
ready on the tray

queer forms with the warm cake-cutters.
Arrange the pieces on
one of the hot plates and cover

The next best thing to seeing
one’s friends is hearing from
them, and the more interesting
the letter the greater the enjoyment,
particularly when
the communication is intended
to be passed around the
entire home circle. There is
a delightful way in which to
express yourself differently from ordinary writing, a method
used by the early Egyptians, called picture writing. The
Egyptian pictures were not at all like those made by
modern artists; their representations were crude and unfinished,
yet they answered very well for the people and the
times. You have advantages over those ancient people
inasmuch as you need not even attempt to draw the designs.
All that is necessary for you to do is merely to look over the
newspaper and magazine advertisements, select the prints
needed, and after cutting out and pasting them on a sheet
of paper, with a few connecting words between, you will
have produced an odd, interesting letter, and the work will
be pure fun.</p>

In the first place the statues must be white—not
nearly white, but very white—flesh,
hair, and costume; then the background
must be black, a dead, lustreless black.
Given these two requisites any figure, or
group of figures, will look like statuary;
and when care and pains are taken in the
posing and draping and the proper light is
thrown on them, the living, breathing,
warm flesh and blood so closely resembles
the cold, lifeless marble, it is difficult to
realize one is not looking at statues carved by the hand of
man.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Stage</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Arrange the background on the stage in the form of a
three-fold screen, with sides slanting outward to the front.
When possible, the top of this space should also be covered
with the black material, slanting up to the front; in this
way the statues are entirely boxed in, the only opening
being the front of the stage. That is, the only apparent
opening, for between the back and side panels a space about
one foot wide must be left for side-lights, and on this account
the back should extend at least one foot beyond each
side-panel.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_282">282</span><b>The Lights</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">A strong calcium light directly in front of the stage,
though some distance from it, is best for amateur tableaux,
and the side-lights at the back need be used only when it
is imperative that no shadows shall be cast on the background,
as in the case of the armless statues. With the
cross-lights thrown behind the statue, the black-covered
arms melt into the black background with no shadows to
betray their presence. Tall piano lamps are best for this
purpose.</p>

<p class="c001">Again, the front light may be placed nearer one side of
the audience-room, and a pleasing effect of light and shade
on the statuary itself be produced.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Pedestals</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Place a platform about one foot high, and of a size to
hold the largest group, in the centre of the stage, and leave
it there as a base for all other pedestals.
Packing boxes of various sizes, chosen to
suit the statues, make excellent pedestals,
and these, as well as the platform, must be
smoothly covered with white cotton cloth.</p>

<p class="c024">Pure white Canton flannel is the best
material to use, as it drapes most beautifully
and takes the true sculptor’s folds.
It should not, however, be too heavy in
weight, else it will be stiff and unmanageable.</p>

<p class="c001">The Greek or classical costume is
almost the only kind you will need, and it
is made simply of two breadths of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_283">283</span>canton flannel sewed together and fastened at the shoulders;
the slits for the arms being left open nearly to the
waist. Under this is worn a sleeveless waist of the same
material. A cord tied around and just under the bust,
and the dress pulled up to bag over gives one style of costume;
tied around the waist and bagging down far below
it, gives another, and both under the bust and around the
waist, still another. The dress should be long enough to
allow of all this pulling up, and if too long when the statue
is mounted on her pedestal, it can be turned up underneath;
no hem is necessary on these garments. An extra piece of
drapery is almost always a part of the costume, and is used
for wrapping around the figure to give the narrow effect at
<span class="fltleft kd100"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_283-fig575.jpg" alt="Fig. 575." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 575.</span></span>

<p class="c024">Make a tightly fitting white cap to entirely cover the hair,
as a foundation for the wig.</p>

<p class="c001">In order to have the parting of the hair directly in the
middle of the head, put the cap on and, with a lead-pencil,
mark the desired line. The rope must be then untwined and
the middle of each strand laid across the top and stitched
down along the pencil line, half the length falling on one
side, half on the other. After this the wig can be donned,
the hair arranged and pinned in place according to taste or
the fashion selected, and then stitched securely to the cap.</p>

<p class="c001">When the hair is done up high and a side or back view
is shown, it is necessary to sew the ends of the rope along
the bottom edge of the cap at the sides and back, as the
locks are drawn up from there. A narrow border of raw
cotton sewed entirely around the edge of the cap so that it
will extend a trifle over the forehead and neck, does away
with the dark edge of hair which it is, otherwise, almost impossible
to hide. When only a front view is desired, the
back of the cap need not be covered with the rope. Men’s
and children’s wigs are made on the same principle, be
their hair long or short.</p>

<p class="c001">The face, arms, neck, and hands must be as white as it is

    <div><b>Subjects for Tableaux</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">It is a wise plan to choose a subject already presented
by some sculptor and copy his work as closely as possible,
for the artist has given much thought and study to the
posing of his figures and the lines of his drapery, and one
can be sure the artistic effect will be good; or a subject may
be found in some painting which will be suitable for statuary,
and this also will have the advantage of having been
designed by an artist. Most of the tableaux should be selected
in this way, but a few variations, where a surprise for the
audience is prepared, or seemingly impossible effects are
produced, gives piquancy and charm to the entertainment.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Armless Bust</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">The effect of armless or mutilated statues which, to the
audience, appear almost miraculous, may be produced by
simply covering the parts of the body, supposed to be
missing, with dull black cloth. Everyone knows that by
covering one of the front teeth with a piece of black sticking-plaster
the perfect effect of a lost tooth is given, and it
is on the same principle that limbs are cut off or figures
decapitated in statuary tableaux.</p>

stockings, or long,
narrow bags. In
this tableau the
side-lights must be
used to prevent
any shadow from
being cast upon the background;
the lights must shine behind the
statue, not on it.</p>

<p class="c001">The pedestal is made of a
packing box, with the top cut
out to admit the figure, as shown in the diagram (Fig. 579).
A fine color effect is produced when this pedestal is covered
with dark red material, upon which rests, to all appearances,
the pure white marble bust. In covering the top of
the pedestal cut the cloth to extend around over the opening
at the back, and it can be fastened down after the bust is

must not be too strong and its full force
should be concentrated on the head and
bust, leaving the arms in shadow.</p>

allow its inner leaves to lap
over the white. Cut in the
medallion, and through the
background, a hole the shape
of, but smaller than, the head
and bust. This should be
experimented with on other
material before the medallion
is cut, so that no mistake be
made.</p>

<p class="c001">The medallion must be
placed at a height easily
reached by the standing figure
of the person posing for
the portrait. The head is
thrust through the hole, then
turned to present a profile

held back that it may not protrude too far through the
opening. The illustration shows the effect of this tableau.</p>

warm welcome, but, like the others, it must be well carried

a seat for the statue of a box
which should be only wide
enough to be comfortable
and of a height to allow of
a footstool under the feet.
Nail a board the width of
the box to the back to form
a back for the seat and let it
be high enough to extend a
few inches above the statue’s
head when she is seated.
Cover the chair and footstool
with the gray canton
flannel.</p>

<p class="c001">The Egyptian statue must
be stiff and formal, seated on
her chair as in Fig. 581, with hands on knees and feet together.
The entire absence of graceful curves of body or
drapery makes a charming contrast to the other statues.
In statuary tableaux the eyes must be kept closed, except
in the tableau of Galatea, and the eyelids should be as
white as the rest of the face. The eyelids of the Egyptian
statue must, of course, be gray.</p>

    <div><b>Pygmalion and Galatea</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">This tableau includes the sculptor as well as the statue,
and requires a little acting on the part of the statue—herein
lies the surprise.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_289">289</span>The tableau illustrates the old story of the Greek
sculptor Pygmalion, who fell in love with the statue he had
made, and prayed to the gods to endow it with life. His

prayer is granted
and the statue, Galatea,
gradually awakens.</p>

<p class="c001">When the curtain
is drawn aside, Pygmalion,
dressed in
Greek costume of
brilliant colors (to
contrast with the
white statue), is seen
kneeling with arms
extended at the feet
of Galatea, who
stands in the pose
shown in “first position”
of the illustration.</p>

<p class="c001">Pygmalion maintains
his position
without moving
while Galatea awakens.</p>

<p class="c001">Standing, as in “first position,” with bent head, closed
eyes and clasped hands, the right foot a little in advance of
the other, the weight of the body resting principally upon
the left, Galatea slowly, very slowly, unclasps her hands
and gradually separates them. The left hand moves out
from her side while the right hand, at the same time, is lifted
outward and upward to her throat, “second position.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_290">290</span>Keeping the left arm extended a little from her side, the
hand slightly raised and fingers bent, she continues to raise
her right hand until it covers her eyes, at the same time
swinging her body around, bearing the weight heavily on
the left foot, until the “third position” is assumed. Holding
<span class="fltleft kd160"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_290l.jpg" alt="Third Position." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Third Position.</span></span>

this pose for an
instant, she turns
slowly back again,
lifting her hand
until it shades her
eyes; she then raises
her chin and bends
slightly forward as
she opens her eyes
and beholds Pygmalion.
This is the
“fourth position.”</p>

<p class="c001">Again she pauses
for an instant, then
by slow degrees the
left arm is raised
while the right one
is lowered and the
hands are held out
in welcome, as in the
“fifth and last position.”</p>

<p class="c001">At no time must the arms form parallel lines; even at
the last the extended arms should be bent very slightly outward
at the elbows. The two sharp angles, formed by
bending the elbows in the same direction at the same
moment, should be especially avoided. At all times during
the awakening Galatea must be so posed that her movements
<span class="pageno" id="Page_291">291</span>might, at any moment, be stopped and she would
<span class="fltright kd175"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_291.jpg" alt="Fifth Position." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fifth Position.</span></span>
be found standing in a graceful and
charming position. Success in this
can only be obtained, and little
awkwardnesses avoided, by practice
before a large mirror, where
every movement and every curve of
the body may be seen.</p>

<p class="c001">No quick or sudden motion must
mar the beautifully slow awakening;
all should be as gradual as the unfolding
of the petals of a rose
until the climax is reached, where
Galatea extends her arms to the
waiting and expectant Pygmalion
and the curtain is  dropped.</p>

<p class="c001">There is no doubt of the success
of the tableau when this little bit
of silent acting is well done, and
it makes an excellent winding-up
piece to an evening’s entertainment.</p>

Assured of their welcome, laughter, jollity,
and mystery all attend the Halloween
frolics which are given up to sports with
kale, apples, nuts, mirror, etc. These ordinarily
commonplace articles are claimed, on
this eventful eve, to be touched with magic,
endowed with the power of prophecy and
enabled to tell of wonderful adventure or
fortune which will befall any one who puts
their virtues to the test. And it is Halloween,
of all the nights in the year, that is
best loved by the sprightly little fairies,
gnomes, and elves, who delight in sallying
forth from their homes under stones and in
old hollow trees to play pranks on us poor mortals. The
witches also are out, flying through the air to their annual
dance, on their queer steeds, either cats or broomsticks.</p>

<p class="c001">James Hogg’s poem, “The Witch of Fife,” gives a comical
description of the witch who flew out of the lum (chimney)
and left her husband, who soon followed with his coat
“waflling in the wynde.” The witches’ rides would not be
apt to injure old broomsticks, but should you happen to see
any cats the morning after Halloween, notice how tired the
poor creatures look after carrying the witches all night!
That is why the Scotch lads and lassies pity the pussies.</p>

none is handy, take a pillow and rip open the end seam
about an inch or so, making the hole scarcely large enough

and forefinger. The little opening can be sewed up again
in a moment’s time. On the bottom end of each downy
messenger fasten a small piece of paper; a drop of paste or
mucilage will be sufficient to gum all three in place. Write
<span class="pageno" id="Page_294">294</span>the word “Blond” on one paper; on another, “Brunette,”
and on the last, “Medium.” Label the papers before gluing
them on the feathers (Fig. 583). With your right hand
daintily hold up one feather, by its top, in front of you, and
gently send it flying with a puff of breath. Do the same
with the next, and also with the last one; the feather landing
nearest to you denotes the complexion of your true love.
To make the test sure, try the charm three times, but be
careful not to use too much force when blowing the feathers.</p>

<p class="c024">It is intended only for the older girls, not being adapted
to little ones. The ghosts are jolly, bright, realistic beings,
full of fun, who, being invited to your house, enter heartily
into the frolic, each doing her best to make the entertainment
a success. All the prominent past century
ghosts must be included in the party. Artistic, dramatic,
historic, literary, and political ghosts should be present, also
the spirit of customs, ideas, events, and things belonging to
the past century. Summon your fellow-ghosts to haunt
<span class="pageno" id="Page_300">300</span>your house three hours before midnight, appearing in costumes
appropriate to their earthly existence.</p>

<p class="c001">Tell them that not a word must be spoken until the company
is relieved from the spell of silence and state in your
invitation that all ghosts are expected to promptly signify
their acceptance in writing, otherwise they will not be admitted
to the haunt.</p>

<p class="c001">When the ghosts have assembled each character should
be announced as she enters the reception-room, where the
hostess and one or two other spirits of the occasion await
the arrivals. The announcement must be made in clear,
well-enunciated tones, and always be prefaced by the words
“The Ghost.” Guests after their introduction are allowed
to speak and they should talk and act as nearly as possible
like the spirits they represent. The event will then be a
success if carefully planned, and you will have given to
your friends a novel and delightful treat.</p>

    <div><b>Fortune’s Wheel</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">is a midsummer game for little folks. Such a beautiful,
long day for a holiday, and no one remembers to keep
it now, although many, many years ago Midsummer
Day, the longest day in the year, was looked forward
to with as much pleasure as we find in the anticipation of
Christmas.</p>

<p class="c001">The people had strange beliefs in those days, and they
thought a being called Fortune would send them gifts on
this holiday if they went through certain performances to
gain her good-will.</p>

<p class="c001">Now suppose we make believe, for a time, there is such
a person as Fortune, and one of you shall play her part, and
we will have a game of “Fortune’s Wheel,” which will be
<span class="pageno" id="Page_301">301</span>very appropriate and interesting for June 21st. At one
end of the lawn we will mark off as many spaces, six
feet square, as there are players, not counting
Fortune.</p>

<div class="figcenter id112">

<div class="ic003">
<p><span class="sc">Fortune’s Wheel</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c001">Rope or twine tied to the fence
at the back, and to stakes driven
into the ground in
front, as seen in the
illustration, will
mark the boundaries nicely, and we
will tie some small flags or bright-colored
streamers to the tops of the
stakes to make them look pretty. These spaces we will call
stalls. About ten yards from the stalls, and directly in front
<span class="pageno" id="Page_302">302</span>of them, we must stretch a rope, tying it to stakes or trees,
so that Fortune shall be kept within bounds.</p>

<p class="c001">Now bring your rolling-hoop, and we will turn it into
Fortune’s wheel by tacking two tapes across it, as shown in
the diagram. In the centre, where the tapes cross, we will
tie a little bag, which is to hold a gift.</p>

<p class="c001">Simple little toys, bonbons, and cake, only one at a time,
however, are the gifts Fortune’s wheel will carry.</p>

<p class="c001">Come, little girl, whoever is to be Fortune, whip out your
handkerchief and tie up your eyes, for Fortune must be
always blindfolded; then stand by the rope, which will keep
you from going too far away.</p>

<p class="c001">The rest of you scamper off and take your places, each
one in a stall.</p>

<p class="c001">Now, Fortune, walk up and down a little that you may
not know exactly where you are; then, standing so that you
can reach the rope with your hand, take your wheel and
strike it hard, sending it down toward the other players.</p>

<p class="c001">Whoever catches Fortune’s wheel may have the gift it
carries, but no one must go beyond his stall to reach it. The
wheel must enter a stall before it can be caught by the player
in that stall, and when it enters a stall and falls to the ground
before being caught, the player whose stall it is in must
change places with Fortune, become Fortune, and roll the
wheel. When the wheel stops before reaching the stalls
and does not enter any of them it must be carried back to
Fortune, who will roll it again.</p>

<p class="c001">Each time before the wheel is started the players in the
stalls must change places.</p>

<p class="c001">When one gift has been won and taken from the bag put
another in its place and Fortune will roll the wheel until all
the gifts are gone and the game ended.</p>

<p class="c023">The endeavor throughout this little play has been to
keep it as simple as possible and quite within the capacity
of the children taking part. The girls and boys should be
well drilled in the marches, that they may keep step and
perfect time, also in the song; and they should know to a
certainty what places they are to take in spelling the words.
Then if, when speaking, they enunciate clearly and speak
slowly the success of the play is assured. Very slowly and
clearly each word must be spoken, otherwise the meaning
and point will be lost.</p>

<p class="c001">The character of the teacher should be taken by a
young girl old enough to lead and direct children. The
marches may be as elaborate as the manager chooses, but
they should not be too long or intricate.</p>

<p class="c001">The shields are made of heavy white card-board after
the pattern shown in Fig. 590, and the handles are strips of
tin fastened in the middle of the shield. To secure the handle
in place, with a sharp knife cut two horizontal slits
about one inch long in the shield near the centre. These
must be about five inches apart, and one directly over
the other. Then make two more slits of the same size,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_309">309</span>one two inches above the top slit, the other two inches
below the bottom slit. Pass one end of the tin through the
<span class="fltright kd100"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_309-fig590.jpg" alt="Fig. 590." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 590.</span></span>
lower top slit, working from the inside of
the shield, and bend the end up, slipping
it back through the upper top slit as if
taking a stitch; then fasten the end by
bending it up close to the inner surface of
the shield. Care must be taken not to
tear the card-board during this process.
Now reverse the order of work, and passing
the other end of this tin through the
two lower slits in the shield, fasten it
by bending the end down. The loop of the handle must
be sufficiently large to allow a child’s hand to slide in and
grasp it easily. When the tin is well wrapped in strips of
cotton cloth there is no danger of a cut from the sharp
edges.</p>

<p class="c001">Large black letters are either painted on the shields or
cut from black paper or cloth and pasted on. These letters
must be simple and plain in design, that they may be
instantly recognized. All the shields should be of one size,
and as a rule should reach from the shoulder almost to the
knee of the bearer. The children, also, should be as nearly
of one height as possible.</p>

<p class="c001">Take your tape-measure and find the width of your
window. It is about three feet wide, isn’t it? Well, it
doesn’t matter. Whatever the width, add two feet more
and you have the
length for your garden.
Thus, for a
three-foot window
you will have a five-foot
garden. Go to
the planing-mill and
select a wide board
of that length. See
that it is without
flaws, and do not be
afraid of having it
thick, for it must
bear a heavy weight.
Buy a pair of strong
iron brackets, or
very likely at the
mill they will give
you two three-cornered
pieces of
board like Fig. 591,
which will answer
the purpose as well.
With screws fasten these brackets to the
board, about half a foot from each end, as in
Fig. 592. Near the back edge of the board, directly above
the two brackets, screw in good-sized screw-eyes, as shown
by A, B, Fig. 592. Measure the distance from the bottom
edge of your board to the top of the screw-eye, as designated
by the dotted line C in Fig. 593, and fasten strong
<span class="pageno" id="Page_312">312</span>hooks in the outer wall on either side of your window at the
same distance above the window-sill. Be careful about
your measurements and have your hooks just as far apart
as the screw-eyes. Go to a hardware store and get a
piece of wire netting, such as is used for fences, long
enough to go around the front and
<span class="fltright kd150"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_312-fig594.jpg" alt="Fig. 594." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 594.</span></span>

side edges of your board. Have three
strips cut from it,
one eighteen inches
wide for your garden
fence, the other
two each twelve inches wide and about three feet long
for trellises for your vines. Fit the fence around the board,
bending it sharply at the corners, and tack in place along
the edge of the board, using double tacks, called staple
tacks, for the purpose. Paint the board and wire netting
dark green, and, when dry, lift it out of the window,
and, resting the board on the outside window-sill, slip the
screw-eyes on the hooks in the wall, as in Fig. 592.
With two staple tacks fasten the ends of the fence to the
wall.</p>

    <div><b>Ready for Your Boxes</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">Get two strong wooden ones from your grocer, about eight
inches deep and of a size to fit the board at either side of
your window, and another to fit between the two end ones.
Bore several holes in the bottom of each box, bind the edges
where they meet with strips of tin, as shown by the dark
strips in Fig. 594. Have the tinsmith cut the tin the required
lengths and also bend it to fit your boxes. It will
then be easy work to tack it on yourself.</p>

<p class="c001">Binding the boxes in this way makes them strong and
prevents their bursting apart, as they are very apt to do
with nothing to stay them. Paint the boxes dark green,
like the board, and on the bottom of each place a layer of
charcoal, next a layer of sand and then fill with earth,

to be no way of getting the simpler kinds but by
going directly to Mother Nature and transplanting them
from her garden to yours.</p>

<p class="c001">Before starting on your search make inquiries and learn
what you may expect to find in the various localities.</p>

<p class="c001">Water lilies are not found on all ponds, but they are
well worth any amount of travelling, and secure some you
must, even if several trips have to be taken before they
are discovered.</p>

<p class="c001">There is a water garden in our neighborhood which is a
source of great pleasure to its owner. Floating on the surface
of the water in two great stone tanks are pond lilies of
several varieties. As the great buds grow and unfold they
are watched closely and with intense interest until they are
suddenly found full-blown, fair and pure, a floating mass of
loveliness.</p>

<p class="c001">Any and every plant which grows in the ponds and
swamps may be made to grow in an artificial pond or swamp
in your own house or yard. The water arum or arrow-leaf;
the pickerel-weed, with its spikes of pale-blue flowers;
the sagittaria, whose flowers are white, and the water
hyacinth are all pretty in the water garden.</p>

<p class="c001">There are vines that grow readily in water which you
can put around the edges of the tank, allowing them to hang
over and partially hide the outside. The Wandering Jew is
one which is very hardy and will droop in graceful festoons
of green. It is not a water plant, but will thrive in water
and should not be planted in the soil at the bottom, but
allowed to send out its roots into the water near the surface.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_317">317</span>Aquatic plants are the simplest of all kinds to transplant,
because the sun does not wilt them when their roots are
kept wet. Transfer the plants in baskets filled with wet
moss, or make them in packages covered on all sides with
several wrappings of wet paper. They can be preserved an
indefinite length of time <i>if kept wet</i>.</p>

<p class="c001">Cat-tail seeds will grow in mud; so will other swamp
plants, and a swamp garden, kept always wet, may be an
accessory to your water garden.</p>

<p class="c024">A friend of mine tells the story of a morning-glory vine
which, growing in water, draped her window luxuriantly
and even blossomed in a timid way. This plant was taken
from the garden when its stem was several inches long and
placed in a bottle of water, where it sent out more roots
and grew rapidly.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_318">318</span>It is possible, too, and is a very pretty experiment, to
start the seeds without soil. Among the plants in my
studio window, a short time ago, was a green glass finger-bowl
filled nearly to the brim with water. On the surface
of the water rested two layers of raw cotton cut to fit the
bowl, and on top of the cotton were scattered a number of
morning-glory seeds. They lay quietly on their soft, floating
bed for a few days, then the seeds began to send out
white worm-like shoots, and shortly there appeared on each
a pair of small heart-shaped leaves tightly clasped together
at the top by the now empty seed-shell. Soon down into
the water, piercing the cotton, little thread-like roots made
their way, growing thicker in mass and stronger as the
young plants shot up in a wonderful growth. We watched
them from their birth until they were three or four inches
high, when an accident brought their existence to a close
and our experiment to an untimely end.</p>

<p class="c001">Almost any seeds will sprout when treated in this manner,
and in order to keep the water pure during the waiting

that the carrot and parsnip can be
made to grow in the same way;
their tendency, however, is to split
at the sides, which allows the water
to escape and causes them to dry
up. I am told that another way to
grow them is to immerse each half
way in a bottle of water, keeping
the vegetable suspended by means
of a darning-needle thrust through
it and resting on the edge of the
bottle. In selecting potatoes
choose those which have a number
of well-developed “eyes,” and
avoid the sweet potatoes which
look temptingly clean and smooth.
In nearly every case these are kiln-dried,
or dried by artificial means,
and no amount of coaxing will
induce them to sprout.</p>

<p class="c001">Take a large potato which will hold considerable water
when hollowed out, cut off one end and clean out the inside
to the depth of several inches. Puncture holes on opposite
sides about half an inch from the edge, pass one end of
a string through each hole and tie, leaving a loop at the top
(Fig. 595), then fill with water and hang at the side of your
<span class="pageno" id="Page_320">320</span>window, where it will not touch the glass nor get the direct
rays of the sun.</p>

<p class="c001">In preparing the turnip remember to turn it upside
down, as it is the root end you are to cut off; this is pointed
and generally ends in a string-like root; the leaves sprout
from the other end and form a pretty foliage. The turnip
will not only send out its own leaves, but vines may be
planted inside which will grow down to meet the upward
growing leaves of the vegetable.</p>

<p class="c001">English ivy grows well in water, and you all know that
the Japanese lily requires only a layer of pebbles in a dish of
water to grow and blossom most beautifully. Hyacinths in

apart.</p>

<p class="c001">The starter at the head of one of the
lines fastens one end of a ball of yarn to
a door-knob or chair just behind her
and, putting the ball on her pan, tosses
it to the player directly opposite, who

again, and kept going until the yarn is all unwound.</p>

<p class="c001">In no case may the ball be touched with the hands.
When it falls to the floor, it must be lifted up with the pan
by the player who drops or fails to catch it, and when the

<p>The Hoop Dance.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c001">Four boys and four girls make up the set for the “Hoop
Dance,” and chance allots the partners, in this way: A stick
is placed on the ground and the group, standing about
twelve feet away, take turns in tossing small stones as
near to it as possible. The girl and boy throwing nearest
the goal take first position; the girl and boy throwing
second nearest take the second position, and so on. The
four couples stand quite a distance apart, at least six yards
being allowed between those facing each other, as in Fig.
597. (Crosses represent boys and circles girls.) One of
the players is chosen leader, and it is his duty to call out the
different figures of the “Hoop Dance.” At “Attention!”
all take position and stand ready, hoop in hand, to respond
<span class="pageno" id="Page_325">325</span>to the first call. The leader then prompts, “First and second
couples cross over right and left.” Immediately the
two boys, B and F, move to the left, as in Fig. 598, in order
to give space for E to roll her hoop between A and B, and
A to pass between E and F. As the leader prompts the two
couples roll their hoops to the opposite sides. Then the
leader calls, “Third and fourth couples right and left.”
They follow the example of the first couple, the boys H and
D moving to the left to give space for C to pass between G
<span class="pageno" id="Page_326">326</span>and H, and G to cross between C and D. The leader next
calls, “First couples right and left back to places,” and this
movement is repeated by the last couples.</p>

<p class="c023">of the dance the girls of the first couples change places, as
in Fig. 599, where A and E roll their hoops diagonally
across the intervening space according to the dotted lines.
This brings A in E's place and E in A's. Next the girls
change places on the sides; C and G cross over to opposite
sides. Then the leader cries out, “Girls of first
couples return to places,” and E and A roll their hoops back
to first position. “The sides do the same.” In like manner
the boys change, first B and F, then D and H, and return
to places, taking great care not to allow their hoops
to fall or get beyond their control.</p>

  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Third Figure</b></div>

<p class="c023">is “Hoops all around.” At “Attention!” from the leader
each player turns, facing the back of the next player. Arrows
point the direction players are to take (Fig. 600). A
turns toward B; B faces C; C looks at D, and so on. Then,
with hoops in position, at the word “Hoops all around”
each player follows the companion directly ahead, rolling
his hoop as he goes around the circle, stopping only when
his original place is reached.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Fourth Figure</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">Again the leader calls, “Attention.” This time each
player faces his partner, stepping a little to one side to
allow the partner to pass (Fig. 597), which brings all the
girls A, C, E, and G, facing the left and outside the ring,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_327">327</span>while B, D, F, and H, the boys, face the right and are
inside the ring. At the call from the leader, “Grand
right and left,” each player carefully rolls his hoop first
to one side, then to the other of those whom he meets
on his way around the circle, beginning with his partner
(Fig. 597). The girl A passes to the right of her partner B,
left of D, right of F and left of H. All the other players
weave in and out in the same way, as in the ordinary quadrille,
the only difference being that instead of the hands
being grasped in passing the hoops are rolled to right and
left. This figure concludes the “Hoop Dance.” Should
the players be all girls, let four of them tie handkerchiefs
on their left arms to show that, for the time being, they
represent the sterner sex.</p>

<p class="c001">The Game of Tag never loses its charm. Who can resist
rushing after a companion at the words “last tag.” No
girl with any daring or enterprise can rest content until the
compliment be returned. Somewhat differing from the
original tag, but none the less attractive, is the game of
the same name played with wooden hoops.</p>

some particular starting-point determine the distance the
players may roll their hoops before “It” is permitted to follow.
The distance is optional—eight yards or so would
do, the place being designated by a house, tree or fence,
as the case may be, and made plain to all by “It” saying,
“I'll stand here and give you all a chance to reach that
tree”—or whatever the object may be—“before I follow.”
At the signal, “Are you ready? Go!” from “It,” all except
“It” start rolling their hoops in the same direction. As
soon as the first player reaches the tree “It” calls out,
“Coming!” and immediately follows. The other players
hearing the word “coming” scatter in all directions while
“It” endeavors to strike someone’s hoop with her stick.
When she succeeds the captive surrenders the hoop to
“It,” who scampers away with her prize to join the others.
The loser, instantly becoming “It,” starts in pursuit of the
nearest hoop. She cannot, however, strike the hoop she
has just lost until the player has had time to run several
yards beyond her reach. The game continues until each
player has been “It.”</p>

other side of the large hoop. The first
player to miss changes places with “It”
and holds the big hoop, giving her
smaller hoop to the first “It”; and the
latter joins the ranks of the players, taking
the last place in the row. The second
to fail surrenders her hoop and in turn
becomes “It.” The game proceeds in
this way until only one player remains
who has not been obliged, through failure,
to take the part of “It.” Such a one is victorious and
the winner of the game. No player is allowed to be “It”
a second time in the same game. The second miss debarring
her from any more trials, she drops from the line to
await a new game, when she will be entitled to the same

<p class="c023">Still it is better not to have more than eight. In determining
the couples who shall race together, eight slender
sticks or broom-straws are used, making four pairs of
straws, each pair of a different length. A player holds the
straws in her hand, showing one end of each. They are
placed evenly, all projecting out the same distance from
the closed hand (Fig. 602). When each player has drawn
<span class="pageno" id="Page_330">330</span>a straw and found her partner, who has its mate, the two
holding the longest straws roll their hoops from the given
starting-point to the goal previously determined. The distance

should not be more than
three or four hundred feet.
The two players having the
next two longest straws take
second turn. Third place belongs
to the two holding the
next longest straws, leaving
those with the shortest straws
last. All who fail to win the
first or trial race fall out of
the game, and the four victors
again draw straws for places as in the first trial. The
two couples race, and then comes the final test between
the last two victors, the other two having dropped out.
The last trial is watched eagerly by the six who are out of
the game and stand as spectators on each side of the
course, cheering the players as they race after their hoops.
The first to reach the goal in this run is hailed as the
champion.</p>

turned at each end by two of the players. The others, in

the turn of the head and the movement of the hands.
When all is ready, the rope turning evenly and steadily
<span class="pageno" id="Page_331">331</span>toward the leader, she runs in and through to the opposite
side without jumping, calling out “Follow me”; the other
players do likewise. Then with the rope turning away
from her she runs back in, jumps once and runs out on the
opposite side. The others follow. Next the leader runs
in, jumps once, then stoops and picks
up a small stone or pebble, which has
previously been placed near the rope,
regaining her position in time to jump
over the rope when it next comes to her feet. Again she
stoops, lays the pebble back in place, jumps once and runs
out. The others repeat this. The leader runs in, jumps
first on one foot, on the other, then on both, and runs out.
The others do likewise. The leader runs in, calling to one
of the followers to join her. They face, grasp each other’s
hands and jump. Still holding hands they raise them over

<p class="c024">Young and old alike enjoy the game whose
object is merely to strike a small ball backward
and forward over a net stretched
across a table. If you have never played
the game it will seem very simple, but
upon first trial you will probably realize
that keeping the ball in motion is not as easy as it appears,
for, instead of returning over the net in an orderly manner,
the ball shows an uncontrollable inclination to jump down
on the floor and hide in some obscure corner, thereby causing
the player to enter reluctantly into a game of hide-and-seek
with the tantalizing little object. However, it requires
only slight practice to gain control of the ball, and the game
is then very fascinating.</p>

ball, the price of which is three cents. Other implements
needed are two rackets, a net, and the frame or
stakes supporting the net. The racket can be manufactured
from a piece of wooden box, or possibly a shingle
<span class="pageno" id="Page_335">335</span><span class="fltleft kd50"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_335-fig606.jpg" alt="Fig. 606." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 606.</span></span>

of an inch thick, or more, is best for the purpose. Cut a
paper pattern first as a guide for
the shape of the racket. Take a
piece of paper twelve and a quarter
inches long and six wide; fold
lengthwise through the centre and cut according to dotted
lines in Fig. 604. Open the paper pattern and place it

the second racket in the same manner. The head
of the racket should be seven inches long and six wide,
the handle five and a quarter inches long and a trifle over
one inch wide (Fig. 605). Saw the stakes from the handle
of an ordinary hearth-broom, or from any strong, slender
round stick. Make each stake eight inches long and notch it
at the top (Fig. 606). As a support for
the stakes use a strip of board three
inches wide, not more than one inch thick, and about four
feet long. If you have no auger to make two holes in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_336">336</span>board for the stakes, burn them through the centre of the
ends with the red-hot point of a round poker (Fig. 607). Be
careful not to make the holes too large, have them rather
small, that the stakes when fitted in may be tight and firm.
A strip of almost any kind of cloth six inches wide, hemmed
top and bottom and cut long enough to stretch taut entirely
across and above the board,
when tied from stake to stake,
may serve as a net. Mosquito
netting or turkey-red cotton
cloth make satisfactory strips;
use whatever material is most convenient. Fig. 608 shows
the net with two narrow tapes sewed at the four corners for
tying it to top and bottom
of the stakes. Stretch
the net across the centre
of a table, preferably a dining-room table, bring
forth your rackets and ball, and practise playing
Ping Pong with some friend, each standing at one end of
the table (Fig. 609).</p>

    <div><b>The Rules</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">are similar to lawn tennis, but there is no second service,
as in lawn tennis.</p>

<p class="c001">The game of Ping Pong is generally for two, though
four players may take part. The double game will afford
great amusement if but two rackets are used, as the player
must lay her racket down each time for her partner to use.</p>

<p class="c001">The player who first strikes the ball across the net is
called the server and the other player is called the opponent.
The idea of the game is to serve the ball so as to
strike the table on the opposite side of the net. The ball is
then in play. If it drops into the net, or does not strike the
table, it counts in favor of the opponent.</p>

<p class="c001">The opponent to whom the ball is served must endeavor
to return the ball over the net so that it will strike upon the
table. The ball is thus sent back and forth until one player
or the other fails to get it over the net so that it will bounce
upon the opposite side of the table.</p>

<p class="c001">The ball is in play so long as it strikes the table-top and
can be taken on the first bounce. Striking before the ball
bounces is not allowed.</p>

<p class="c001">When the game is finished the server becomes opponent
and the opponent server, and so on, alternately.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_338">338</span>If the ball in play strikes any object above or round the
table before it bounces on the table-top itself (net or post
excepted) it counts against the player.</p>

<p class="c001">The server wins a stroke if the opponent fails to return
the ball or returns the ball in play off the table.</p>

<p class="c001">The opponent wins a stroke if the server serve a fault,
or fails to return the ball in play, or returns the ball in play
so that it falls off the table.</p>

<p class="c001">No volleying is allowed; but as long as the ball touches
the table-top it is in play and can be taken at half-volley.
The opponent loses a point if he takes the ball on the volley.</p>

<p class="c001">The player who first wins six games wins a set.</p>

<p class="c001">The service must be strictly underhand and delivered
from behind the end of the table.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Scoring</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Your opponent scores—If you do not return the ball; if
you strike the ball before it touches the table; if the ball
bounces twice.</p>

<p class="c001">You score—If your opponent strike the ball out of play
or bounces the ball his side of the net.</p>

<p class="c001">On either player winning his first stroke, the score is
called 15 for that player; on either player winning his second
stroke, the score is called 30 for that player; on either
player winning his third stroke, the score is called 40 for
that player, and the fourth stroke won by either player is
scored game for that player, except when both players have
won three strokes (40 all); the score is then called deuce,
and the next stroke won by either player is scored advantage
to that player. If the same player wins the next stroke, he
wins the game; if he loses the next stroke, the score is
again called deuce, and so on, until either player wins the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_339">339</span>two strokes immediately following the score of deuce, when
the game is scored for that player. In naming the score the
server is always mentioned first, for convenience, as 30-15,
signifying 30 for server and 15 for opponent.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Terms Used in Ping Pong</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024"><i>Let</i> means that the ball, while being served, touches the
net in passing over, and the server has the privilege of
serving again. If the opponent makes a let stroke it counts,
the same as if the ball had cleared the net.</p>

<p class="c001"><i>Volleying</i> means striking the ball before it bounces.</p>

<p class="c001"><i>Half-volleying</i> means striking the ball just as it bounces.</p>

<p class="c001"><i>Underhand stroke</i> means striking the ball with the head
of the racket pointed downward.</p>

<p class="c001"><i>Overhand stroke</i> means striking the ball with the head of
the racket pointed upward.</p>

<p class="c001"><i>All</i> means same score for both players—as 30 all, meaning
30 for server and 30 for opponent.</p>

<p class="c001"><i>Deuce</i> means a tie.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Game</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Begin by taking plenty of time and serving slowly. Remember
to strike the ball lightly; too much force will send
it flying to the other end of the room, which is to be avoided.
Keep cool and think what you are doing.</p>

<p class="c001">Your mind must be centred entirely upon the game.
Grasp your racket close to the head, and when serving keep
your racket down; the ball must not be held above the waistline
and must be served beyond the end of the table.</p>

<p class="c023">out of doors, and when confined to the house by inclement
weather, a bad cold, or some other disagreeable thing, was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_340">340</span>very apt to grow restless and fretful, complaining always
that she did not know what to do. She had any quantity of
beautiful toys, but, as she said, she was tired of them all.</p>

<p class="c001">Then it was that the family would induce her to try to
make something for herself, and when once she became
interested in her work, and found that by her own ingenuity
she could manufacture, from odds and ends, many interesting
little toys, her restlessness vanished, and she was
once more cheerful, happy, and contented.</p>

<p class="c001">At one time she had a book presented to her which gave
the patterns and directions for making a few little articles—a
very few it seemed to her, for she speedily did all the
work laid out there, and was again thrown on her own
resources for new ideas.</p>

<p class="c001">A Make-believe Sewing-machine</p>

<p class="c001">When she was quite a small child, too young to be
allowed to sew on a real sewing-machine, she constructed
a machine which, with the aid of her imagination, did very
good work. Of course she could not really sew on it, but
neither could she have done so had it been a “sure-enough”
sewing-machine, and there was sufficient reality about it to
make her play very absorbing.</p>

<p class="c001">The small wheels on top went round with a whiz and a
whirr that filled her soul with delight. There were two
wheels, because they were the remnants of a mechanical
toy, a horse and sulky, which was once driven by a handsome
tin jockey. The horse and jockey were gone, but the
wheels and machinery remained. The key to the clock-like
works was likewise missing, but it was very easy to
wind up the spring by turning one of the wheels round and
round a number of times. Once wound up, the wheels were
bound to go until the machinery ran down again, and it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_341">341</span>was while going at full speed that the pretended sewing
was done.</p>

<p class="c001">No, these two wheels were not all of the sewing-machine
by any means. There was the arm made of pasteboard,
with needle attached, which, shaken by the vibration of the
turning wheels, moved up and down quite naturally. All
this was on top of a small table, underneath was the treadle
made of the back of an old geography laid across a piece of
kindling wood. The treadle would sometimes slip out of
place with the rapid movement of the little girl’s feet, but
that was of no consequence, since it was only the work of a
moment to replace it. The fact that there was no large
wheel mattered nothing either, for the little seamstress felt
her feet moving up and down, saw the wheels whirling on
top, and was satisfied without a wheel that could not be seen
anyway.</p>

<p class="c001">The sewing-machine was such an ambitious idea that it
required some imagination to carry it out successfully, but
there were other things this little girl made which were
quite complete in themselves, such as toy houses, furniture,
and dolls.</p>

<p class="c001">Knowing how thankfully this same little maid received
any suggestions which would assist her in the manufacture
of her home-made toys, I take it for granted there are other
children who will be just as grateful for new ideas and who
are just as happy in carrying them out. If you happen to be
such a little girl, you will be glad to learn about this impromptu
game of croquet which you can make for yourself
in half an hour and enjoy the use of for many a long day.</p>

inches from the starting stake, arch No. 2 four inches from

    <div><b>Rules for Playing</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">First—The object of the
game is for each player to
send her ball through each
arch in turn, beginning at
No. 1 and using her mallet
for striking her ball. When
a ball has passed through
arches Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
and 7, according to their
numbers, it must strike the
stake just beyond No. 7,
then returning through
arches 7 and 6, it must move
on through No. 8, through
No. 4 again in the direction
opposite to the one taken
in its first passage; then
through arches Nos. 9, 2
and 1, striking the stake to
“go out,” and the first
player to do this wins the
game.</p>

<p class="c001">Second—To decide who shall open the game, or be the
first to play, each player in turn shall place her ball (marble)
directly under the first arch and play for the stake. The
one whose ball, after playing, stands nearest the stake has
the privilege of the first turn, the next nearest the second
turn, and so on.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_344">344</span>Third—The first play with each ball shall be made after
placing it half way between the starting stake and arch No.
1,  and the player may aim for the arch or any ball which
has entered the game, or may send her ball in any direction
she may choose.</p>

<p class="c001">Fourth—A ball failing to make its first arch must remain
where it rests until next turn; passing through its arch
gives the player another play.</p>

<p class="c001">Fifth—When a ball strikes another the player may croquet
or roquet the ball in any direction she wishes, and
then have another play. No ball may croquet or roquet
another more than once in one turn unless it passes through
an arch or strikes the stake between the croquets.</p>

<p class="c001">To croquet a ball the player places her ball touching the
one it has just struck; then, resting her finger on her own
ball to hold it steady, she strikes her ball with her mallet,
sending the other in any desired direction. To roquet a
ball the player places her ball touching the one just struck
and strikes her ball, moving them both at the same time.</p>

<p class="c001">Sixth—A ball rolling off the table must be replaced at
the point where it went off two inches from the edge.</p>

<p class="c001">Seventh—When a ball has passed through all of the
arches it becomes a “rover,” and need not strike the starting
stake and go out until the player wishes. A rover has
the privilege of croqueting or roqueting any or all of the
other balls in each turn, but may play on each ball only
once during one turn.</p>

<p class="c001">Eighth—The game may be played with partners, or
each may play for herself. When there are partners each
side takes a turn alternately.</p>

With the opening of the basket-ball
season the girls are all wide-awake,
interested, and eager to
enter the teams; there is an exciting
dash and life about the
game which renders it very fascinating.</p>

<p class="c001">If you can organize a set of
ten players and divide the</p>

an equal portion, the individual expense need not be
exorbitant.</p>

<p class="c001">The price of a good basket ball is four dollars, and a pair
of goal baskets the same amount, making in all eight dollars,
just eighty cents each, a small amount when compared
with the fun, health, and general benefit to be derived from
the sport. The expense will be even less if shared by the
officials.</p>

<p class="c001">It is optional whether you play indoors or out of doors;
the game is suited to either place. The size of a</p>

available space, but it must not exceed 3,500 square feet.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="c001">Mark out your field, making the width less than the
length, according to Fig. 614. If indoors, use black paint
for marking the inch and a half wide boundary lines; if out
in the open air have the lines white, of the same width as
the black, and made with
either whitewash, chalk,
paint, or plaster-of-paris.</p>

<p class="c001">You must have the side
boundaries of the field at
least three feet from the
wall or fence, and the end
boundaries directly below
the pole or wall surface
against which the basket
goals are placed. The inclosed
field is divided into
three portions (Fig. 614).
Two more inclosures are
necessary, called foul limits;
make them inside the
two end divisions, Figs. 614.
The boundary line of the
curved end must be equally
six feet distant all around
from station line indicated
by a short straight line in
the centre of the inner end of foul limits in both divisions;
the station line must be fifteen feet from the goal or outer
edge of basket; the space across from the straight lines of
the foul limits must measure six feet.</p>

<p class="c001">Mark centre of field with a circle of a foot and half
radius (Fig. 614), or two lines one and a half feet apart.
If marked by circle the girls playing centres must stand
<span class="pageno" id="Page_348">348</span>within it; if two lines are used they must toe the lines.

that the basket goals are firmly fastened in place and rigidly
supported either on a strong upright pole, or on a wall

surface. If on poles it is better
to have a screen six feet wide
and four high as a background,
though this is not absolutely
necessary. During practice and
ordinary games leave the netting
open at the bottom of the basket,
that the ball may fall through the
basket to the floor or ground
beneath, it being difficult for
girls to get the ball out of the
basket when it is closed at the bottom. Using a pole to
push the ball out is not always attended with satisfactory
results, and the effort consumes valuable time and strength.</p>

<p class="c001">The baskets are called the goals; usually they are hammock
nets of cord, sometimes metal chain links; they are
always suspended from metal rings
eighteen inches in diameter (inside).
The back part of the metal ring is fastened
to an iron bar which extends six
inches from the pole or wall to which it
is attached (Fig. 615). The</p>

layers, an inside rubber bladder and an
<span class="pageno" id="Page_349">349</span>outside cover of leather. The rubber is tightly inflated and
the cover so laced that it cannot be caught or held by the
lacing. The ball measures from thirty to thirty-two inches
in circumference and weighs from eighteen to twenty
ounces (Fig. 616).</p>

<p class="c023">is ten, making five on each side, though the game is occasionally
played with more. The set sometimes numbers as
many as twenty members, ten on each side; but such teams
are rare, and generally undesirable. Large teams crowd
the field to such a degree that very little skill is required
to reach the goal, and action to a great extent is rendered
almost impossible.</p>

<p class="c001">Each side chooses its own</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Captain</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">who must be one of the five girls constituting the side.
There are always two captains in a game, and they should
be selected with care, as much depends upon their proper
qualifications for holding the office. In addition to other
duties, the captains toss for the choice of goals, are active
players in the game, represent their respective sides, and are
entitled to call the attention of the officials to any violation
of the rules which they may think has occurred; it is their
further duty to furnish the scorer with lists of their sides,
giving the positions of the players. The captain appoints
the forwards, guards, and centre.</p>

<p class="c001">The game calls for nine more girls; these do not take
active part in the play, but hold positions as officials. The
officials with a set of ten players necessitate nineteen girls
for the usual game. The nine</p>

    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_350">350</span><b>Officials</b></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">at least four days before the game. She must be absolutely
neutral and perfectly impartial; to her belongs the honor of
holding the most important office in the game. It is the
referee’s duty to see that the regulations respecting the ball,
goal, and grounds are adhered to.</p>

<p class="c001">By mutual agreement of the captains, the referee may
allow alterations in the rules regarding time and grounds,
but not as regards goal, ball, or team. Before the commencement
of the game she must ascertain the time for
beginning, or any other arrangements that have been made
by the captains.</p>

<p class="c001">The referee must watch the ball constantly, following it
wherever it goes. She must know at all times the whereabouts
of the ball, as her office constitutes her judge of it,
and she must decide when the ball is in play, to whom it
belongs, and when a goal has been made. Every time the
ball is put in play the referee tosses it up, she alone having
the right to do so. The referee calls time, when necessary,
by blowing a whistle, and she must always call a foul when
any player addresses an officer. No player is allowed to
talk to the officials, though anyone may speak to the captain
and the captain can address the officers; in that way
only are the players able to communicate with the officers.</p>

<p class="c001">The referee decides all questions not definitely falling to
the umpires and linesmen, scorer and time-keeper, but is
powerless to alter a decision of the umpire or linesmen regarding
matters under their jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_351">351</span>The referee instructs the team when to play, and either
side refusing to begin the game within three minutes after
the whistle sounds forfeits the game.</p>

<p class="c001">The referee’s term of office expires at the conclusion of
the game, and her decision awarding the game must be
given then, as she no longer has power to act as referee.
The referee must disqualify members when they are guilty
of shouldering, tripping, striking, kicking, hacking, or of intentional
or unnecessary roughness of any kind. These constitute
fouls, and the referee overlooks the first offence, but
not the second. When a player is disqualified she must
drop from the game and a substitute take her place. A foul
is a violation of the rules, whether committed unintentionally,
ignorantly, or otherwise; the only guide an officer has
is the cold fact that a foul has been made.</p>

<p class="c001">Each team chooses its own</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">

<p class="c023">who must be a thoroughly competent and impartial girl.
The umpires call all fouls except cases coming under the
authority of the referee; when the fouls are made by players
crossing the field lines, linesmen judge them.</p>

<p class="c001">Each umpire makes her own decision independently of
the other, but a foul called by one umpire cannot be questioned
by the other. The umpire calls time by blowing a
whistle when stating a foul and indicating the offender; she
reports to the scorer the player at fault and the nature of
the foul. The referee appoints the</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Scorer</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">who must keep the score. She must be perfectly neutral.
It is the scorer’s duty to notify the referee when a player
<span class="pageno" id="Page_352">352</span>should be disqualified for any kind of roughness. The referee
appoints the</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Time-keeper</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">who must be exact about the time, noting when the game
starts, and blowing her whistle at the expiration of the
actual playing time in each half previously agreed upon by
captains and referee. The time-keeper must take out time
when called upon to do so by the referee. The captain is
privileged to ask the referee to call time for an injured
player or when a difference has occurred between the captain
and an official. The half game is generally fifteen minutes,
making the entire game thirty minutes, not counting
the intermission. The playing time may be shortened to ten
minutes for each half or lengthened to twenty for each half.
The referee only may order time deducted for necessary
stoppages, should any occur during the game. The four</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Linesmen</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">are appointed by the referee; two for each side. These
four girls usually stand at the four corners of the centre
division, and it is their duty to report if any of the players
step on or cross over the dividing lines. Such offences are
counted fouls. When the ball happens to be thrown outside
the field boundary lines the players are allowed to rush
after it, but are not allowed to go beyond the dividing lines
when in the field.</p>

will assist you in gaining a clear understanding of the different
<span class="pageno" id="Page_353">353</span>positions occupied by the various members of the team
when in position to commence play. The object of the
game is to <i>throw the ball into the opponent’s basket</i>, and this is
best accomplished by the girls being coupled with opponents
and stationed at various places all over the field. In
<span class="fltright kd250"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_353-fig617.jpg" alt="Fig. 617." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Fig. 617.</span></span>
Fig. 617 the girls on one
side are represented by
circles, those on the other
side by crosses. We will
suppose that the two
captains have tossed for
goals, and that to the
circles has fallen the goal
G and to the crosses the
goal H. In the centre of
the field are grouped
three girls, one player
from each side, and the
referee, who is here indicated
by a triangle.</p>

<p class="c001">The referee stands with
the ball in her hands, facing
the other two girls,
having her back turned
toward the side of the
field (Fig. 617).</p>

<p class="c001">It is optional on which
side of the centres the
referee is stationed.</p>

<p class="c001">The two players stand facing each other with their sides
turned toward the referee, and each has her back toward
her own goal (Fig. 618). These two players, circle and
cross, are known as</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_354">354</span><b>Centres</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">There are always two centres in a game, and it is their duty
to jump quickly for the ball as it leaves the hands of the
referee, who opens the game by tossing the ball vertically
in the air immediately between and not more than two feet
<span class="fltleft kd250"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_354-fig618.jpg" alt="Circle Centre. Triangle Referee. Cross Centre." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Circle Centre. Triangle Referee. Cross Centre.</span><br><span class="small">Fig. 618.</span></span>
from the centres. Fig. 618
shows the referee ready to
toss the ball. Each centre
endeavors to catch the ball
and pass it to one of the
forwards on her own side,
with the hope that it may,
sooner or later, land in her
opponent’s basket; at the
same time she tries to prevent
the ball from being
passed by the opponent’s
guards across the centre of
the field toward her basket.</p>

<p class="c001">The centres must confine
their play within the central
space; they cannot step across the dividing lines running
from side to side of the central division of the field. In
each of the end divisions are stationed two girls called forwards
and two others known as guards; their duties are
implied by their titles. The forwards endeavor to forward
the ball to their opponents’ basket, and the guards guard
their own goals, striving to prevent the opponent forwards
throwing the ball into their basket. In Fig. 617 the circle</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Forwards</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">are in the end near their opponents’ basket H, that they may
have a better opportunity of sending the ball into it, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_355">355</span>the cross forwards are on the other end of the field near the
circle’s basket trying to engineer the ball into that goal.
You will notice that the guards on each end protect their
own basket. Standing by each cross forward is a circle</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Guard</b></div>

</div>

<p class="c023">who endeavors to prevent an opponent from succeeding in
her efforts for the goal, and on the cross end of the field
the two cross guards are trying to protect their basket from
the circle forwards.</p>

<p class="c001">The stars in Fig. 617 stand for the four linesmen, who
must be continually on the <i>qui vive</i> and report if a girl steps
over the dividing lines.</p>

<p class="c001">Each umpire watches both sides; generally one umpire
walks about just outside the field boundary line on one side
of the field, and the other walks just outside the boundary
on the other side of the field. It is optional which side they
take, but they should not both be stationed on the same
side. Fig. 617 shows the circle umpire on the right hand,
and the cross umpire on the left hand of the field. The
umpires are designated by circle and cross, with rays extending
all around them.</p>

<p class="c001">The time-keeper stands outside of the field, that she may
not interfere with the action of the players; other than that
restriction, she may move as she pleases. In Fig. 617 the
time-keeper is denoted by a round black spot.</p>

<p class="c001">The scorer must also keep out of the field proper and
have her mind on her portion of the work. In Fig. 617 the
scorer is designated by a square.</p>

<p class="c001">When all stand ready the</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Game</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">begins. The referee tosses up the ball, and every one of
the players on the field eagerly watches the two centres as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_356">356</span>they strive to catch the ball. The centre, gaining the advantage,
endeavors to toss it to a girl on her own side,
while the other centre does all in her power to prevent the
ball from reaching its destination, often running in front of
the victorious centre, blocking the way and still further
interfering by throwing up her arms. If the first centre
succeeds in tossing the ball to one of the forwards on her
side, that forward immediately strives to get the ball in the
opponent’s basket, but is constantly followed and opposed
by the opponent guard, who endeavors to frustrate the
play. Should the forward decide that the chances for gaining
the goal are better if she throws the ball to another girl
on her side, she does so with the hope that the other forward
will succeed in caging the ball. If, however, the last
forward be baffled, she tosses the ball either to her own
centre, back to the first forward, or over across the field to
one of her own guards, anywhere the rule permits in order
to keep the ball from the hands of the opponents.</p>

<p class="c001">If one of the opponent forwards succeeds in capturing
the ball she tries either indirectly, with the aid of others
on her side, or directly, by her own exertions, to cage the
ball in the basket of the opposite side.</p>

<p class="c001">The centre catching the ball from the referee is privileged
to throw it to any player on her own side, either
forwards or guards, at one end or the other of the field,
her action depending upon circumstances. Sometimes it is
more advantageous to toss the ball in one direction, again it
is better to throw it in another. Therein lies the secret of
good playing, the ability to see opportunities in time to
profit by them and quickness and accuracy in measuring distances,
so that the ball may land where the player intends to
send it, not falling short or getting too far. The opponent
centre constantly follows the centre having the ball, and is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_357">357</span>ever at her side trying to obtain the ball or prevent it from
reaching its destination.</p>

<p class="c001">The forward catching the ball after it has been advanced
to her by her own centre or by guards from the
other end of the field, or obtaining it from an opponent,
generally throws for the basket, and she must be able to
make the goal under many difficulties and from various
positions. Should the ball miss the basket the forward will
have no time for regrets, it being necessary for her to turn
her immediate attention to regaining possession of the ball
or to preventing it from falling into the hands of the opposing
guard.</p>

<p class="c001">The forward must have a cool head, must be calm, and
able to decide and judge quickly; she must take the situation
in at a glance and make the most of any, even the slightest,
opportunity of forwarding the interest of her side.</p>

<p class="c001">The guard’s principal duty is to prevent opponents from
getting the ball into the basket belonging to the guard’s
team, and when possible to obtain the ball and throw it to
the centre on her side, or across to her own forwards.</p>

<p class="c001">The guard’s position requires that she be very skilful
and constantly on the watch to defend her goal.</p>

<p class="c001">The players are on the field in couples, but the two
standing together are always opponents; a player is never
stationed by one of her own side. The game is thus in part
played in couples, that is, the two placed together pay
especial attention to each other and are, for the time being,
each the particular opponent of the other, trying to foil all
efforts of the other to gain any advantages in the game, at
the same time endeavoring to assist the players on her own
side.</p>

<p class="c001">The inner divisions for fouls, Fig. 614, are ignored except
when a foul has been made; then the side opposed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_358">358</span>to the one committing the foul has a free throw for the
basket and the foul court is in use. The player having
the free throw stands on the line in the centre of the circle
of the foul division (Fig. 614), and must be allowed to take
time to aim well and throw for the basket. No other player
is permitted to stand in or pass through the limits of this
court while the player with the ball is trying for the goal.
The object in marking the inclosure is to prevent any other
girl approaching nearer than six feet to the player throwing
for the basket. The foul court must be absolutely free
from all obstruction during a free throw, nor shall the
player having a free throw step from the station line until
the ball has entered or missed the goal.</p>

<p class="c001">When a player is given the privilege of a free throw,
the ball cannot be tossed to any other player; it must be
thrown for the basket. Should this rule be violated, the
goal will not count if made, and the referee takes the ball
and tosses it up in the centre as at the beginning of the
game. If by chance the free player is interfered with in
any way, and she fails to make the goal, she can try again,
and then, in case the ball does not land in the basket, the
ball is in play and the game continues.</p>

<p class="c001">The ball may be thrown or batted with the flat part
of the hand in any direction, either with one or both
hands.</p>

<p class="c001">While in the field a girl cannot carry the ball nor hold
it longer than three seconds; she must play it from the
spot where she catches it, unless she happens to be running.
If while running she catches the ball, she must stop as soon
as possible; should she fail to do so, in the opinion of the
umpire, the umpire may call a foul. When the player captures
the ball she either throws it at once or stops running
as soon as possible. Allowance is made in such cases, but
<span class="pageno" id="Page_359">359</span>the player cannot consume time by turning around without
making progress in the game.</p>

<p class="c001">A player cannot bound the ball on the floor more than
three times, and never lower than the height of the knee;
however, this does not interfere with her throwing for a
goal twice or more in succession.</p>

<p class="c001">The player who has the ball is the only one in the field
who may be intentionally blocked in her way; all other players
must be free from intentional interference.</p>

<p class="c001">The foul which disqualifies a player counts against her
side.</p>

<p class="c001">The ball is</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Out of Bounds</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">when it completely crosses the boundary line of the field.
Should it bounce or roll back again the game continues,
except if the whistle of the referee is blown; then the ball
is put in play as if it had not returned to the field.</p>

<p class="c001">The time allowed for a game is always divided; when
the first part has been played, time is called for a rest by
the whistle of the time-keeper. Generally the intermission
lasts ten minutes, sometimes longer, the game being resumed
after the recess. While resting the players wrap
themselves up to keep from taking cold, and are not permitted
to drink cold water.</p>

<p class="c001">After each goal the referee puts the ball in play in the
centre of the field; this she must also do at the commencement
of the game and at the beginning of the second half of
the game. At the end of the first half the sides change
goals, except in case of a tie, when the game continues
without changing goals until either side has made two additional
points. These points may be made either from field
or from fouls. The game is won by the side scoring the
greater number of points during the entire game.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_360">360</span>If the goal (in case of uprights) is moved by an opponent
when the ball is on its edge, one point is scored by the
side throwing the ball.</p>

<p class="c001">The game is decided by the winning of the most points
in the actual playing time. When there are two fouls at
once on opposite sides, each side has a free throw for the
basket; afterward the ball is put in play from the centre
by the referee. Whenever it becomes necessary for the
referee to call “time,” because of illness or accident to a
player, play must be resumed in five minutes. If the injured
player is unable to resume play</p>

    <div><b>Rules</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">A goal made from the field counts two points; made from
a foul, one point. If a player by mistake should throw
the ball in her own basket, it counts for the opponents.</p>

<p class="c001">After time has been called the referee puts the ball in
play by tossing it up in such a manner that it will drop near
the spot where it was when time was called, unless it was
held out of bounds. In this case play is resumed at the
whistle of the referee as if time has not been called.</p>

<p class="c001">The two opponents nearest this spot when time was
called vie with each other to obtain the ball after play is
resumed. They are indicated by the umpire.</p>

<p class="c001">When the ball is held by two or more players for any
length of time the referee blows her whistle, stops the play
and throws the ball up from where it was held.</p>

<p class="c001">Whenever the ball is put in play the players who are to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_361">361</span>first touch the ball must not stand further than two feet
from the spot where the ball is to fall.</p>

<p class="c001">When the ball goes out of bounds and remains there, it
must be returned by the player first <i>touching</i> it. There can
be no interference with her returning it; that is, no portion
of the person of an opponent may be outside of the field of
play. The ball cannot be touched by an opponent until it
has crossed the line. If either of these rules is violated,
the ball is to be returned to the player who had it and the
ball again put in play at the original place.</p>

<p class="c001">The player holding the ball may throw it in any direction
into the field of play from any spot (outside of bounds)
on a line drawn at right angles to the boundary line at the
point where the ball crossed it. The ball must be <i>thrown</i>
into the field of play. When either of these rules is violated
the ball goes to the opponents at the same spot. The
ball must be thrown to some player and disposed of before
the player who passed it can again play it.</p>

<p class="c001">When a player obtains possession of the ball outside the
limits of the field she is allowed five seconds to hold it; if
the ball is held longer it goes to the opponents. In case of
doubt in the mind of the referee as to which player first
touched the ball, she tosses it up into the field of play at
the spot where it went out.</p>

<p class="c001">When the ball is <i>batted</i>, <i>rolled</i> or <i>passed</i> from the field of
play, in order <i>to claim exemption</i> from interference it must
be given to the opponents at the point where it left the
field of play. When it is passed to a player out of bounds
the ball is given to the other side. <i>Carrying</i> the ball from
the field of play is a foul. When the centres are jumping
for the ball and one of them bats it to out of bounds, it is
in play and goes to the other side.</p>

<p class="c001">A goal scored by a player while any part of her person
<span class="pageno" id="Page_362">362</span>touches the ground out of bounds shall not count. In such
a case the ball is put in play in the centre of the field.</p>

<p class="c001">If a player throws for the goal and the whistle of the
referee, umpire, or time-keeper sounds while the ball is in
the air, and the throw results in a goal, it is a count.</p>

<p class="c001">When the umpire’s whistle sounds simultaneously with
either the referee’s or time-keeper’s, the umpire’s takes precedence.</p>

<p class="c001">A goal scored before the whistle can be blown for a
foul made by the side scoring, does not count; but if a
player while throwing for the goal is fouled by an opponent
and succeeds in scoring, both count.</p>

<p class="c001">Two hands on a ball are necessary to secure it. In case
of doubt in the mind of the referee as to which player first
put her two hands on the ball, she shall toss it up at the spot
where it was held by the players. In no case may a player
remove the ball from the hands of an opposing player,
either by <i>snatching</i> or <i>batting</i>.</p>

<p class="c001">The ball may not be held longer than three seconds.</p>

<p class="c001">The ball may not be “juggled”; <i>i.e.</i>, tossed into the air
and caught again to evade holding.</p>

<p class="c001">Crossing field lines with any part of the body constitutes
a foul.</p>

<p class="c001">No player may lean over or reach over another player.</p>

<p class="c001">No player may hand the ball to another player. The
ball must be <i>thrown</i> to another player.</p>

<p class="c001">These official rules are intended especially for girls'
basket ball as played in most of the well-known colleges,
Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Smith, Wellesley, etc., and by the
majority of schools except in and around New York, in
which section both girls and boys play the boys’ game.
This differs from the girls’ in having greater freedom and
consequently more action, players being allowed to run
to any part where they think they can be of most use within
the extreme limits of the field. The dividing lines from side
to side of the field are omitted, and the girls must be equal
to greater exertion and more violent action for the boys'
game.</p>

<p class="c001">The girls’ game is considered the safest and best for
them, being adapted for girls; yet some champion players
<span class="pageno" id="Page_364">364</span>prophesy that ere long the boys’ game will be the one
generally played by both girls and boys. If girls enter into
the boys’ game they must keep in training that their strength
may equal the demands. They must not shed one tear when
occasionally hurt, though such accidents need not occur if
all rudeness is avoided. Should one girl unintentionally
run against another during the game, precious moments
cannot be wasted in apologies, there being no time for either
excuses or tears. While the sport is going on the player’s
mind should be all earnestness and determination, too intent
upon the game to allow thoughts for other things. Girls
will soon acquire greater moral and physical courage by
playing basket ball, and sufficient nerve to keep back the
tears. Their self-control will be vastly improved and their
endurance, strength, quickness of action, and judgment
rapidly strengthened. All these qualities are essential, not
only in basket ball, but in helping one to understand the
art of living.</p>

The word grows broader and is more and
more filled with meaning as we begin to
understand that “neighbor” may embrace
in its kindliness not alone the whole human
race, but all the animal creation with which
we come in contact.</p>

<p class="c001">These denizens of the woods and fields
are indeed our neighbors, and so also are
the queer folk whose lives are partly or
wholly spent in the water. When we learn
to look for them we will find life full of the
beauty, the music, and the good-will of
our little friends and neighbors.</p>

<p class="c001">Few of these out-door acquaintances force themselves
upon us; they are not at all sure of their welcome, so we
must keep our eyes and ears open that we may learn their
haunts and meet them at least half way. While strolling in
the country it is pleasant to walk along laughing and singing
as we go, but we must refrain if we really wish to come
near any of the bright-eyed, suspicious little creatures.
They can only be approached very quietly, for wild things
understand an unusual noise only as a danger signal, and
will start in alarm at the least sound or sudden motion, and
be up and off before we are conscious of their presence.</p>

<p class="c001">If your stroll leads you through the woods listen for the
chatter of</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_367">367</span><b>The Squirrel</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">This saucy rodent belongs to a large family, with many
branches and ramifications, and squirrels of some kind are
to be found in almost any wooded spot.</p>

<p class="c001">The scolding remonstrance to your invasion of his domain
will probably reach you before you catch a glimpse
of him; but sit down and wait quietly, Mr. Squirrel will
soon appear, and very likely his little wife will follow
him. Cautious, alert, yet really unafraid, they will approach
nearer and nearer, until they are quite close enough
for you to mark their peculiarities and decide to which
branch of their family they belong. You may even pass
the compliments of the day with your little host if you
speak gently and softly. They are not timid animals, and
will quickly make friends with anyone who treats them
kindly. In Daytona, Fla., where they are absolutely undisturbed,
the squirrels are very numerous, filling the great
moss-laden trees, scampering over the lawns and fences and
even eating from the hands of those who will regularly feed
them, all the while living in entire freedom, without restraint
of any kind.</p>

<p class="c001">Wherever you may find the squirrels, their nest is probably
close by, hidden in a hole in one of the trees. Be careful
how you thrust your hand into such an opening, however,
for squirrels have sharp teeth and may resent such undue
familiarity. About the first of April the nest will be filled
with a promising family of little ones from four to six in number,
and if you can take such a family under your supervision
and “grow up with them,” as it were, you will be amply repaid
by the amusement the merry little creatures will afford
and by the opportunity to observe, with the privilege of an
intimate friend, their house-keeping and manner of life.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_368">368</span>You will know</p>

  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Red Squirrel</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">by his color, during the summer it is a red-brown with a
white vest bordered on the sides with a dark line. He
changes his coat twice a year, and his winter garment is
duller and not nearly so red, while the vest is gray without
the dark border.</p>

<p class="c001">When you find a squirrel’s nest in the crotch of a tree
instead of in a hole you may be pretty sure it belongs to
the gray squirrel, which is said to be the most easily tamed
of all its family.</p>

<p class="c001">Do not mistake</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Chipmunk</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">for a squirrel, although he does resemble one and his lively
chatter seems to be in the same language. He is, in fact,
sometimes called a ground squirrel, but in reality he is
only a distant cousin.</p>

<p class="c001">You will not be so apt to find him in the interior of the
woods as in more open places; his favorite promenade is
the top of a stone wall or rail fence. He is a little fellow
with a flat, bushy tail and well-developed cheek pouches,
which he fills with seeds and nuts until his cheeks are
puffed out equal to a boy’s when he eats an apple.</p>

<p class="c001">The tawny little chipmunk of the Eastern States has
two white stripes and five narrow black ones down its
back. In the West there are other varieties, the little
black and white striped fellow of the Rocky Mountains
being the prettiest and tamest.</p>

<p class="c001">The chipmunk is an engaging little creature, tamer even
than the squirrel, and he will often come close to the house
and sometimes enter it in search of food, it is the dogs that
generally drive him away, for no dog, however well behaved,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_369">369</span>can resist chasing a chipmunk. He is easy game, for he
seldom climbs a tree, and unless he can find refuge in his
hole or under the wood-pile his life is soon the forfeit.</p>

<p class="c001">Do not look in a tree for the chipmunk’s nest, you will
not find it there, but perhaps at the foot of the very pine
under which you are standing, or beneath the large rock
which lies in your path there is a small hole opening into
a little hollow, and in this underground chamber is the
soft, warm nest and the store of food which the chipmunk
has providently laid by. Here it sleeps through the cold
winter months, waking only to eat a few nuts, seeds, or
grains of corn, soon to drowse again, and remain asleep until
spring has come once more.</p>

<p class="c001">When you see a small, brown, long-bodied animal, not
much larger than a rat, running swiftly along the ground,
you may be pretty sure it is our neighbor</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Weasel</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">His home is probably near the river or the borders of the
meadow, but he hunts his game with such intelligence and
persistence it is possible to meet him almost anywhere.
We frequently hear this little animal spoken of, not always
with praise, and it is strange he so seldom crosses our
path, for he does not stand in much fear of his human
neighbors. The weasel is very quick and active, and also
quite inquisitive; it lives on frogs, birds, eggs, and mice,
and the farmers complain that it seeks larger game in their
poultry yards.</p>

<p class="c001">Mr. Dan Beard tells an interesting story of a walk in the
woods where he found a weasel asleep in a deserted crow’s
nest at the top of a tall tree. It is possible the little brown
intruder might have been able to explain just why the nest
was empty of all save himself.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_370">370</span>The sharpness and cunning of the weasel’s character is
shown in its face. A low forehead, pointed nose, eyes small
and penetrating plainly denote these qualities, yet it is a
most interesting little animal and well worth all the study
and observation you can give it.</p>

<p class="c001">A very small neighbor to be found on the borders of the
woods or a shady road is the pretty, harmless</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Salamander</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">Seldom more than two and one-half inches long, this little
creature is slender and daintily made, with a tail quite the
length of its head and body. Its skin is smooth, not scaled
like the lizard’s, and is generally brilliant in color. One
variety is bright red, darker on the back, where it has spots
of a brighter red encircled with dark rings. I have found
many of them in Pike County, Pa., and always in damp
places, though never in the water. There is another kind
that lives in the water, but my little red friends, while loving
dampness, remain always on land. You will generally
find them under stones or logs, and after a shower they are
also to be met in the open, though they do not travel far
from their haunts. Take one up in your hand and examine
the delicate forefeet, so much like fairy hands. They will
cling to your finger in the most winning fashion and you
may examine the little animal at leisure, for it is clean and
harmless. If you wish to keep the salamander for further
study, place it in a perforated box with damp moss or even
damp blotting-paper, and remember to keep it moist, otherwise
it will simply dry up. I know whereof I speak, for a
friend who was with me in the mountains, wishing to carry
two of the salamanders home with her, placed them in a box
without moisture of any kind and when we lifted the lid the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_371">371</span>next morning the poor little creatures were dead and as dry
as two sticks.</p>

<p class="c001">The salamander feeds on small insects, but I have never
seen them eat in captivity. That they may be safely transported
and established in new homes has been proved, for a
gentleman from Seattle, Wash., who was visiting at our
Pike County, Pa., camp, became so deeply interested in
these creatures he took a pail of them across the continent,
and at last accounts they were living in his garden, to all
appearances quite as comfortably as in their native woods.</p>

<p class="c001">On the trunks of some of the great trees you are passing
you may possibly see a number of queer, semi-transparent
shells. These are the cast-off armor of</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Cicadas</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Locusts you will probably call them, but that name
rightly belongs to quite another insect. Perfect in every detail,
even to the great bulging eyes, the cicada’s little coat of
mail clings to the tree with its six pairs of claws like a live
creature, and only a split down its back shows its emptiness
and tells how the cicada crept from the old into a newer
and fuller life.</p>

<p class="c001">The shells one usually finds belong to quite a large
black and green insect, one of the more common species of
cicada. This is called the dog-day harvest fly, and requires
but two years to develop, while the smaller red and black
variety is known as the “seventeen year locust,” because it
spends seventeen years of its life underground before it
reaches maturity. All this while it bears the name of
nymph. A pretty name for the young insect, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="c001">The nymph began life as an egg which its mother deposited,
with a number of others, in a slit she made in a twig
of a tree. For six weeks it lay snugly in its narrow bed,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_372">372</span>then came forth a tiny white creature, with little legs which
carried it about in a lively manner. Its mouth was simply
a hollow tube which would change into jaws later on. For
a while the nymph was happy in its new-found life, then
<span class="fltleft kd225"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_372.jpg" alt="Cicada and Shell." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Cicada and Shell.</span></span>
suddenly a longing for quiet
seemed to come over it and
it dropped to the ground,
there to bury itself in the
earth, which was to be its
home for many years.</p>

<p class="c001">Down in the mysterious
darkness, in that busy world
where so much we do not
understand is going on, the
little nymph grew very
slowly for a year, nourished
by the juices of the roots he
found near him and which
he sucked up through his
tube-like mouth. Then he
shed his first skin for another,
which gave him
greater freedom for further
growth. After a time this
skin was also discarded, another
and another, until, we are told, six times his garment
was changed while yet he was deep in the earth, with no
one to see and admire his new attire. Then when seventeen
long years were passed and his days of preparation
were accomplished, he dug his way up into a new world at
the dictate of a new impulse, and one evening he emerged
to find himself in a goodly company of his kind, all intent
upon reaching a still greater height. The tree under which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_373">373</span>he had lived so long was his goal, and up this he made his
way for some distance, then, forcing his little claws into the
bark, he clung to his place awaiting his final transformation.</p>

<p class="c001">Presently his nymph-skin opened down the back and the
cicada, a nymph no longer, crawled slowly out. White
again as when he first saw the light, except for two black
spots on his back, soft and helpless he clung anew to the
bark. At first his wings were so much a part of his body
you would have thought he had none, but almost immediately
they began to unfold and grow, becoming transparent
and firm as he waved them slowly back and forth. During
the night his color was marvellously changed from white
to black and red, and the next morning came his season of
rejoicing. With all faculties fully alive, he joined the
chorus of the other cicadas and the woods were made to
resound with their high, rasping notes.</p>

<p class="c001">By the way, do you know</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>How the Insects Sing?</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Or, rather, they do not sing, the noise they make is instrumental,
not vocal, and their instruments are usually carried
under their wings, a part of themselves to be played upon
at will, when and where they choose.</p>

<p class="c001">The cicada’s instrument is a kind of drum, and, as if one
would not be sufficiently noisy, he carries two, one behind
each of his hind wings. He has no drum-sticks, but
vibrates his drums until the natural buzzing sound rises
almost to a shriek. Other insects play on other instruments,
but, however the sound is made, each species has a
note of its own, not to be mistaken for that of any other.</p>

cover the ground you will be likely to find the

<p class="c023">the delight of all children and an object of interest to
everyone. This wonderful little ghost flower, so purely,
white and so quickly blighted by exposure to sunlight
appears to live for its beauty alone. As far as we know it
is of absolutely no use, and does not even provide for itself,
as do other plants. It is a root parasite and draws its
nourishment from the roots of the pine upon which it has
fastened itself. The stem as well as the blossom is silvery
white, it has no foliage, and the flower at the end of the
stalk bends its head as though ashamed of its idle life, but
it continues to live on the vital juices of the roots and we
call it the Indian Pipe because it somewhat resembles the
long-stemmed Indian calumet, or pipe of peace. The botanists,
however, know it as the <i>Monotropa Uniflora</i>.</p>

yellow dress, and stands as proudly erect on its slender
stalk as though troops of admirers were to pass its way,
when, in fact, it is rarely seen save by those who seek it.
As its name suggests, it resembles an Indian moccasin in
shape, the hanging pouch forming the toe, while the heel is
clasped by five pointed and twisted petals. Over the opening
of the pouch there is a little flap, which has much to do
with the fertilization of the flowers. The botanical name
of this little orchid is the <i>Cypripedium</i>, and some call it

the largest being not over a quarter of an
inch in length. Some are brown in color
and some black.</p>

<p class="c023">in the soft earth. You will frequently find
them around ponds and the margin of
brooks. They make a most interesting
study, and will soon enable you to learn which of your
forest neighbors has visited the spot before you.</p>

<p class="c001">A small, delicate impression, much like that of a dainty
little hand, will show that</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The ’Coon</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">has been along, and this is all you are likely to see of him
unless you take a moonlight stroll, for Master 'Coon shuns
daylight, and is about only at night. Being a pretty and an
<span class="pageno" id="Page_376">376</span>intelligent little animal, he is sometimes tamed and even
allowed the freedom of the house, like a dog or cat, but
'coons are as mischievous as monkeys, and very frequently
the little hands are used to work disaster among the household
gods. When that occurs a chain is used to keep
Master 'Coon out of further trouble and consequent punishment.</p>

<p class="c001">The 'coon’s fur is long, thick, and of a pepper-and-salt
gray. Its tail is decorated with rings, and its broad white
face is marked with three radiating black lines across the
forehead and black settings to its eyes.</p>

<p class="c001">Though all you find is the footprint of this nocturnal
little fellow you may rest assured that somewhere, just
above your head perhaps, he is snugly curled up in the
hollow of a dead limb awaiting the darkness, when he will
sally forth to seek his supper.</p>

<p class="c001">In the softly creeping twilight, when the woods become
more mysterious, and one’s nerves are almost like the wild
things in their quick response to sudden noises, the night
prowlers begin to awake and stir about. Before darkness
quite settles down is the time to make the acquaintance of
the night birds, nocturnal insects, and some of the small animals
which avoid the garish light of day.</p>

<p class="c001">Though they love darkness better than light these little
creatures are just as harmless as the ones you have seen in
the genial sunshine. Do not be startled, then, if a small
dark body suddenly sails through the air near you, but
watch it in its flight, see how it courses downward, always
downward, on a gradual incline until, with a short upward
curve, it alights on a low branch or trunk of a tree. From
the summit of a tall pine its flight has been, perhaps, fifty
yards, yet it has no wings and in the dim light you will
see before you only a big-eyed, satin-coated little squirrel,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_377">377</span>and you will have met, <a id="corr377.1"></a><span class="htmlonly"><ins class="correction" title="sic">it may for</ins></span><span class="epubonly"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56588/56588-h/56588-h.htm#c_377.1"><ins class="correction" title="sic">it may for</ins></a></span> the first time, your

    <div><b>The Flying Squirrel</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">Look closely and notice that he wears a suit of brownish
gray, white underneath, bordered with black, which fits him
so loosely about the legs and sides that when he stretches out
<span class="fltright kd200"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_377.jpg" alt="Flying Squirrel." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Flying Squirrel.</span></span>
and flattens himself he may
almost be said to be web-legged,
and can sail through
the air like a parachute.</p>

<p class="c001">The natural home of the
flying squirrel is a hole in
a tree, where he makes a
soft nest, deep enough to burrow into until completely hidden.
But a hole anywhere, except in the ground, attracts
him. Whole families will take up their quarters in an unoccupied
house if they can squeeze themselves through some
crack or crevice, and will frequently refuse to vacate when
the rightful owner appears and claims the premises.</p>

<p class="c001">I have several times made pets of the young flying
squirrels, and they are the prettiest, most friendly and entertaining
little things imaginable, as tame as kittens and as
harmless. They are nocturnal in their habits, sleeping all
day in their woolly nests and scampering about all night,
full of mischief and merry play.</p>

<p class="c001">If you wake one of the baby squirrels from its nap and
take the drowsy little thing in your hands you will love it
immediately; it is so soft, so babyish, so unresisting.</p>

<p class="c001">A rare but most beautiful dweller in the woods is the</p>

<p class="c023">named for the moon and sometimes called the “queen of
night.” One evening just at dusk it was my good fortune
<span class="pageno" id="Page_378">378</span>to find a luna moth clinging to a forest tree by the roadside.
It had but recently emerged from its chrysalis and
was slowly moving its delicate wings back and forth, drying
them in the warm night air and strengthening them for
flight.</p>

<p class="c001">The <i>Tropœa luna</i>, as the scientists call it, is one of the
giant silk-worm moths. It has the large, fuzzy body of the
moth, with the feather-like antennæ; but its wings are
unusual in shape. Nearest the tail they are extended to
form long appendages, which curve gracefully outward.
The color is a delicate light green, the edges
of the fore-wings are bordered with a band of purplish
brown, and they are further ornamented with four large
eyes.</p>

warm, bright sunshine.</p>

<p class="c001">The birds leave the shade to sit on the old rail fence and
sing joyously. You will see the busy little wren here, tripping
about importantly, and the song-sparrow, too, which
loves to perch on the top rail and sing its heart away.
Hidden deep in the tangled grass or nestled amid the clover
you may find the nest of the bobolink. Do you know the
lines which occur in one of Saxe Holm’s stories:</p>

      <div class="line">Intimate friend of the bobolinks.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">When you remember these you will remember to look
for the bobolink where you see the red clover.</p>

<p class="c001">There is a concert going on at this very minute; do you
hear it? The high soprano is taking the lead, the soft,
gurgling notes of the contralto are coming in, and now the
whole chorus has burst into song and one of the sweetest
of Nature’s anthems is being given. You must hear it,
some of you, for no matter what the season, in this great
land of ours, somewhere the warm summer sun is shining,
somewhere, without money and without price, these beautiful
songsters are pouring out their souls in exquisite
melody.</p>

<p class="c001">Stop and think what the birds are doing for you; think
of what life would be without them and how near akin
they are to all that is joyous and bright within you; read
“The Birds of Killingworth” in Longfellow’s “Tales of a
Wayside Inn” and then wear the dead bodies of your little
friends on your hats if you can.</p>

    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_380">380</span><b>Woodchuck’s Hole</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">It is generally on the side of a hill or knoll, and in front of
it is a small pile of earth which the woodchuck has taken
out in his excavations. The hole is large enough for a small
dog to enter, and leads to several tunnels, some of them
twenty or twenty-five feet long. If you remain quietly near
for awhile perhaps you will be rewarded by seeing the
woodchuck, or ground-hog, as he is sometimes called, peep
cautiously out of his front door and then come boldly forth
to look about and see what is going on in the outer world.
Make a sudden noise and he will sit up on his haunches with
hanging forefeet, like a begging dog, and then dart into
his hole to remain in hiding until it seems safe for him to
venture out again.</p>

<div class="figcenter id003">

<div class="ic003">
<p>Woodchuck and His Hole.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="c001">The woodchuck is a snub-nosed little animal, a trifle
larger than a good-sized rabbit. Its tail is short and bushy
and its hair long, coarse, and of a brownish color, ears low
and inconspicuous, and eyes round and bright. At the approach
<span class="pageno" id="Page_381">381</span>of winter he retires to his nest, which is in a chamber
at the farthest end of his longest tunnel, there to sleep
or hibernate until spring. A popular legend has it that on
the second day of February the ground-hog—he is always a
ground-hog in this connection—is sure to be up and out to
see how high the sun is and investigate the general progress
of things.</p>

<p class="c001">You know the rest of the story; how he prophesies an early
or late spring by his actions on this important day. If he stays
out we will have an early spring; if he goes back we will have
winter weather for six weeks longer; and his going and
staying are determined by the sun. This is because the
ground-hog is supposed to be absurdly afraid of his shadow,
which he has not seen for so long, and if the bright sunshine
reveals it to him he is said to return ignominiously to his
hole, where he will remain for another six weeks. If, on
the other hand, the day proves cloudy, and there are no
shadows to alarm him, he concludes that he has slept quite
long enough, that there will be no more winter, and that it
is high time to be up and about his business.</p>

<p class="c001">The farmers hunt the woodchuck because of its voracious
appetite for green things. They say it takes more than its
share of the farm products, and they make forcible objections.</p>

<p class="c001">June is the time to find the baby woodchucks, which in
this month play like puppies around the entrance to their
home.</p>

<p class="c001">And now these few remaining pages must be devoted to
our small neighbors of</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>The Sea-shore</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c024">To some of them at least; a volume would not give space
for all.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="pageno" id="Page_382">382</span>It is on rocky coasts or the shores of bays and inlets that
you will find most of the creatures which make their home
on the borders of the vast and mighty ocean. Along a
rugged shore like that of Maine, where the storms and
great breakers carry the water high upon the rocks, little
pools are formed, and in one of these natural aquariums there
is enough life for a summer’s study.</p>

<p class="c001">Undisturbed by the rising and falling tide, the water is
transparently clear, and you can see distinctly all the inhabitants
of this little water-world. Clinging to the rocky sides
are what appear to be silvery pink moss and brilliant
aquatic flowers. Lying at the bottom or amid the jagged
stones are round, prickly looking balls which resemble chestnut
burs, some of them no larger than a tiny pearl button.
So much like vegetables do all these things appear,
it seems hardly possible they are animals; yet the moss is
sometimes called the</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Nurse of the Jelly-fish</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">and some of the small bubble-like bags clinging to its stems,
which give it the silvery appearance, are full of eggs that
will hatch into minute jelly bodies. After various transformations
and subdivisions these bodies develop into the
wonderfully beautiful and fairy-like jelly-fish which you
find swimming in the deep waters of the bay, some of them
trailing long, filmy, lace-like skirts or veils as they move.</p>

<p class="c001">The delicate red, green, yellow, pink, and lavender blossoms,
which add so much to the beauty of the pool, are</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Sea-anemones</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">Animals, too, every one, living only on animal food, which
they find and absorb in a peculiar manner. The fringed
petals are in reality tentacles that reach out and draw food
<span class="pageno" id="Page_383">383</span>into the mouth at the centre, from which it is taken into the
stomach just below.</p>

<p class="c001">How the baby sea-anemones are born, how they are
cared for by their mother, how they are at first “foot loose”
and afterward become fixtures on the rocks, you must
study out for yourselves; the description here is but an
introduction at best and must be necessarily brief.</p>

<p class="c001">The queer-looking green burs, which you will see moving
about if you watch them closely, are the</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><b>Sea Urchins</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">You have, perhaps, found some of their beautiful shells on
the beach, empty of all life and bleached quite white by
<span class="fltright kd175"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_383a.jpg" alt="Shell of Sea Urchin." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Shell of Sea Urchin.</span></span>
the sun. Where the green spines
grew are regular rows of bead-like
projections, looking like strings of
pearls; but, lovely and pure as the
shells are, they cannot possibly be
as interesting as the real creatures,
full of life, crawling about at the
bottom of the crystal pool on
<span class="fltleft kd200"><img src="./What a Girl Can Make and Do, by Lina and Adelia B. Beard_files/i_383a.jpg" alt="Sea Urchin." class="ig001"><br><span class="small">Sea Urchin.</span></span>
the tips of their prickly looking
spines.</p>

<p class="c001">I have never found a live
sea-urchin except in these
quiet pools, probably because
they do not like to subject
themselves to the buffeting
waves, and when in deep water hide in the crevices of the
rocks or bury themselves in the seaweed.</p>

<p class="c001">Unlike the sea-anemone, they are vegetarians and seldom
indulge in animal food. The mouth is underneath
the little animal, where you find the round hole in the shell.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_384">384</span><b>Starfish</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c023">too you will probably see crawling over the rocks at the
bottom of the pool. Although called by that name, these
strange, five-fingered creatures are no more fish than the
sea-urchins, and their life is not so much of the water as of
the ground below. The starfish may swim, but it greatly
prefers gliding about over the slippery stones and sandy
bottom, searching for the small shellfish which form its
food. If you will place a starfish in a small fish globe filled
with salt water, or in any clear glass vessel that is large
enough, you can see its numberless feet, which are little
tubes projecting from the under side of the five rays. This
wonderful waving mass of tube feet is quite concealed when
we look at the animal from above, and until we have discovered
them its rapid movements seem very marvellous.</p>

<p class="c001">There are barnacles looking like a part of the rock to
which they are firmly attached, tiny crabs darting hither
and thither, various species of small mollusks and numerous
other forms of salt-water life to be found in Nature’s beautiful
rock aquariums, but we must leave you to make their
acquaintance alone, while wishing you much joy and happiness
in your intercourse with these and all of your little
neighbors.</p>

<p class="c001"><span class="small">From <span class="sc">Charles Dana Gibson</span>: “It makes a man of a boy and a boy of a man.”</span></p>

<p class="c001"><span class="small">“This book is praiseworthy from end to end, and will find favor even with those who
have long since passed to man’s estate.”—<i>The Nation.</i></span></p>

<p class="c001"><span class="small">“It is one of the completest things of the kind ever written, and with it one can hardly
conceive how a boy could be without pleasant and profitable amusement at any time. It
treats of directions for every season of the year, in and out of doors, and on land and water.
One of the best things about it is that it furnishes employment for a boy’s ingenuity and
mechanical skill. It seems as if this book must be destined to an immense popularity.”—<i>The Advance.</i></span></p>

<p class="c001">Mr. Beard’s book tells the active, inventive, and practical American boy
the things he really wants to know; the thousand things he wants to do, and
the ten thousand ways in which he can do them, with the helps and ingenious
contrivances which every boy can either procure or make. The author
divides the book among the sports of the four seasons; and he has made an
almost exhaustive collection of the
cleverest modern devices, besides
himself inventing an immense number
of capital and practical ideas.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
